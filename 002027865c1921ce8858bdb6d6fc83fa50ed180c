      "message": "I am pretty confident about this patch on the UI side - but the remaining use of isDefaultBuildCmd in org.eclipse.cdt.managedbuilder.internal.core.BuilderFactory.USE_DEFAULT_BUILD_CMD means it can now affect the builder itself in a way that I can\u0027t tell the effect of. So introducing this in 10.2 M1 instead of 10.1 RC1/2 is better.",

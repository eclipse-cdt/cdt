      "message": "I\u0027m not sure that it is good idea to cache the preference value in the constant, even for default scope. This way we will start to rely on things like bundle start order and class loading order.\n\nMoreover, the concept of constant itself is not OOP-friendly, I would prefer to see a class that is responsible to retrieve a \"relation\" value, without publishing a detailed way how to do that.",

      "message": "Sorry, this still a work in progress. I did want to move the getNode call to a method out of start order concerns. I need to test product customization too. This change also has a lot of impact so I need to do more testing and examine the delta events and make sure the tests didn\u0027t make assumptions.\n\nI\u0027m not sure about making a new class to retrieve the single default value. This class already has the responsibility of managing this relation value.",

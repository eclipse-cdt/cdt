      "message": "If the QualifiedName is some sort of template instance I can\u0027t think of any case where after the colons a reference to its template definition would make sense, apart from maybe a template alias inside the template instance. But then the binding wouldn\u0027t be the same as templateDefinition anyway.\n\nIf binding is itself a template instance this will fall through and can be covered by the isSameType check afterwards.\n\nAfter your initial intervention (thanks you did) I didn\u0027t find a solution inside the isSameType method that would do the job so I changed tactics.\n\nThe statement above should work for implicit, partial and explicit template instance, for template definitions from the AST and from the PDOM.\n\nFinally, if the QualifiedName does not refer to a template instance then the comparison is against null.\n\nDoes this sound reasonable?",

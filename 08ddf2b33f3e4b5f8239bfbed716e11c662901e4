Maybe it\u0027s better to do the monitor.done() at the calling site?\n\nUsing SubMonitor consistently, you don\u0027t have to call done() anymore, _except_ for the top-level monitors that get passed in Job.run() and similar framework operations.\n\nUsing SubMonitor inconsistently in a call chain may lead to strange effects, since the convert(original_monitor) will consume whatever ticks are left in original_monitor. So if one switches to SubMonitor, one has to drill down from such top-level Job.run() or similar call sites. I can\u0027t tell if that has been done here.",

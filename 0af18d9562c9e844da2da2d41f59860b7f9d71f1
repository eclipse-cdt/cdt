      "message": "Ok, looking at the two GDB commands being created, using the result of toPortableString()/toOSString(), they seem to be interpreted by the GDB client, not the server. So using toOSString() would probably work ok for the remote case.\n\nHowever since we believe that Windows host -\u003e Linux remote client is the most popular CDT debugging scenario, we should probably test this first. I do not have access to a Windows machine ATM. I will see what I can do.",

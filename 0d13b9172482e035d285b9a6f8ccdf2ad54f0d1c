      "message": "Unless there is a reason to change the fail message can you restore the messages in the new functions to match what was there and the other messages, e.g.\n\n    BreakpointService problem: breakpoint mismatch (wrong file name)\n\nIf there is a compelling reason to change perhaps we should change all of them, but make that the subject of another patch.\n\nPS I really appreciate changing from an assertTrue/False to an assertThat as the latter has much more useful error messages.",

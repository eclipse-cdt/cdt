It also likely to cause regressions according to the Javadoc of PDOMProxy that reads: \"The PDOMProxy is returned by the PDOMManager before the indexer kicks in. Also and more importantly it is returned when the indexer has been shut down (clients may not be aware of this yet). Doing that prevents the creation of empty PDOMs for deleted projects.\"",

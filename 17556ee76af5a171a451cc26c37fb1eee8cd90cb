I\u0027ll write testcases for that. BTW: Is it possible to run this stuff on a windows-CI. Windows behaves slightly different in terms of paths, with is a PITA.",

Sadly many of the windows tests are bitrotten, so it is a non-trivial task, plus so many tools are needed on a machine.\n\nIn the meantime I am more than happy to help you with the Windows stuff. Just let me know which parts I can help with.",

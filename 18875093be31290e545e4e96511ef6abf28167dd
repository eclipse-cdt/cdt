      "message": "I find this interesting - because when I reviewed the earlier patchset I wondered why the test on line 1377 wasn\u0027t \"sizeToType.size \u003d\u003d 8\", but I guess I don\u0027t  understand fully. With this test it implies that sizes of 5, 6, or 7 are permitted/exist too (as \u003c\u003d4 is fully handled by if block above). However I thought that only 1, 2, 4, 8, and 16 were real sizes here.",

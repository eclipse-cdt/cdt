Consider the following:\n- We have two independent interfaces I1 and I2.\n- We have a class C that implements both interfaces I1 and I2\n- W have an array of I1 objects A.\n- An instance of C could be an element of A.\n\nWe could not create an InstanceOfPredicate for filtering I2 (new InstanceOfPredicate(I2.class), which might be a desired filter.",

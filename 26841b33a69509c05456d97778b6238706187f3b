      "message": "I tried to do a smaller set of updates, but as the version of /pom.xml is needed for the baseline compare, all other pom.xml needs to point to this new version and that brings all the different feature/plugins with it.\n\nWhile doing the update, I noticed that org.eclipse.cdt.debug.dap ships a lot of files that should likely not be part of the jar file. The first build of this changeset should show it (unless it\u0027s a problem with my local build!).\n\nI also noticed several plugins/features that have a pom.xml while I see no obvious reason for it. Tycho should be able to generate that content automatically.",

      "message": "Good point, at this point I think I would lean towards keeping it, just as that would open up a use case that I have not encountered. Specifically the logic before would have said, any non DefaultLaunchDescriptor has its configuration retrieved via provider.getLaunchDescriptor (the for block below), getAdaptor would never have been called in this context on anything other than a DefaultLaunchDescriptor. The use case I was going after here was DefaultDescriptors which support targets, so those ones I let fall down to the code to retrieve the configuration via getLaunchConfiguration. Removing that outer if would then presume the non DefaultDescriptors implement an adaptor for ILaunchConfiguration, which I can\u0027t guarantee would be true for all descriptors out there, so as of right now I don\u0027t think there is a compelling reason to open up that path.",

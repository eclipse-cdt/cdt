I can see the target file for the 9.2 branch has this same location (i.e. 9.2 build is dependent on master branch).",

CDT does not need to depend on native, since it builds native.\nI\u0027ve tried to build without this dependency and it works on my machine.  I\u0027ll try on Hudson but in a different commit.\nDoug, did I miss something?",

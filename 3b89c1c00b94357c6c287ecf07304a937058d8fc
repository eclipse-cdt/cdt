If the specialization is an explicit one (or an overloaded template method/function?) then we should not try to replace it with the primary template, right?\n\nUnfortunately, I can only find ICPPTemplateInstance that is giving me that information.\n\nOTH I am a bit hesitant whether that is the right place to do as the problem I\u0027m having is with a TemplateId that gets bound to an explicit specialization when CPPTemplates.getInstance(...) is called without seamingly checking the point of definition (would finding the definition even be the job of \u0027CPPSemantics.declaredBefore?)",

      "message": "My concern here was regarding \"stub\" parameters to call the cc.json parser. In general, I don\u0027t like the idea of returning null (here from the map) and then thinking what to do with it on the client side. But I found that I do not understand pretty clear at the moment how to make the good replacement for IScannerInfoProvider. May be it should be Optional\u003cIScannerInfo\u003e or `NoScannerInfo implements IScannerInfo` (not yet exists).\nWe can postpone this discussion.",

      "message": "Looks like all 3 maps can be final, we do not gain a lot from its lazy creation.\n\nMay be we can have `CompileCommandJsonParser implements AutoClosable`? This will allow us to make it mostly immutable and have close() method to do the clean-up.",

      "message": "I played around with the AutoClosable idea but came to the conclusion that it would complicate the to use this class.\n\nEach of the 3 maps is just carrying internal state used  only while the parse method runs.\n\nIMHO, the problem is that some of the information needed to parse the JSON file is passed in the ctor, some of the information is passed in the parse() method.\n\nWhat if we change method \u0027parse()\u0027 to be static and take each needed parameter? parse() would then construct a CCJS object to carry the internal state while parsing. No method or ctor except that static parse() method would be the public then.\nClients would then just call\nCCJP.parse( CBuildConfiguration, IIndexerInfoConsumer, ICommandLauncher, IConsole , IProgressMonitor);\n\nWDYT?",

      "message": "Using commandDone() is a good idea but using the CommandCache to do it does not seem appropriate.  The processing of CLI commands is unrelated to the cache; it just happens that the cache is notified of any command being sent.\n\nNotice that CLIEventProcessor_7_0 also uses commandDone() to process CLI commands.\n\nI still feel all CLI processing should be in CLIEventProcessor_7_0.  But I understand that you may need to Register information to finalize your feature.  Normally, you should be able to call the IRegisters service from CLIEventProcessor_7_0 to do what you need.  If the IRegisters API is not sufficient, we can do a couple of things:\n\n1- create a new API in the registers service that can be called to do what is needed\n\n2- create a \u0027fake\u0027 MI event that CLIEventProcessor_7_0 will send out and that GdbRegisters will listen to and take action on",

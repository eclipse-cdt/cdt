It\u0027s quite possible that no other changes are required when switching from Java 7 to 8, but it for sure wasn\u0027t true when switching from 6 to 7.\n\nIt probably makes sense to make this script less general and don\u0027t pretend that it can handle arbitrary Java versions.",

So I think we\u0027re safe except for the pom.xml changes that Thomas noticed.",

      "message": "It can be done, certainly, though so far, I was mostly trying to optimize cases where we do a loop just to access a single field - with the expectation that with many fields, it\u0027s more convenient to do a loop rather then call getMIValue for all possible field names, anyway.\n\nI can certainly create a map on the first invocation, possibly if the results.length is 3 or great. Just let me know.",

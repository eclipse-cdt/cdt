      "message": "In the short term the case is that Gnu Eclipse plug-ins have been depending on this for a while - even though it leads you to a bad return from getGdbPath.\n\nAt the moment this method really should not return null ever (which it does if you have true as that causes a CoreException). The reason is that all callers to getGDBPath use the return value without checking for null.\n\nSo it does indeed seem like a bad idea, it is simply the bad idea that has been there for a while now. \n\nThe proper fix would be to handle the case of substitution failing -- and then make sure that Gnu Eclipse plug-ins could resolve.",

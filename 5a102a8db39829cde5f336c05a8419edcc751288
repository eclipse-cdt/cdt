Even though it is a  CPPASTAttributeOwner, it seems to me that the standard does not allow for attributes here.\n\n[gram.stmt] allows for attribute-specifier-seq on try-block but [gram.except] does not further allow for attribute-specifier-seq on neither handler-seq nor handler.\n\nMaybe its a \"bug\" that ICPPASTCatchHandler is a CPPASTAttributeOwner in the first place?",

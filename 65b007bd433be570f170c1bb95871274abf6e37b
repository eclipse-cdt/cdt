What I\u0027m trying to say is that the marker for a the illegal bytes cannot be an allowed character or there will be an ambiguity.\n\nSo my followup question is; how should these be encoded?\n\nsrc/dir\nsrc-dir\nsrc_dir\nsrc-รถ-dir\nsrc/รถ/dir\n\n\nBy the way, with my version, \"src/dir\" is encoded as \"src-2fdir\", but yes, it\u0027s harder to read than \"src-dir\" or something similar.",

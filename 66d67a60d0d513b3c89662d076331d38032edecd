      "message": "fCommandCache stores the MI command we sent to GDB for a particular context.  My guess is that it can also be associated to an IMemorySpaceDMC.  In that case, I believe it should also be cleared when its parent IMemoryDMC resumes.\n\nIf I\u0027m right, you should be able to trigger this issue by requesting the exact same memory after a resume or suspend; my guess is that a cached MI command will be returned with old values.",

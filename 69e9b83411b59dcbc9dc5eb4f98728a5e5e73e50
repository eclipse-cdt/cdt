I have to come up with a test but \n\u003e basically if there is code like\n\u003e goto b;\n\u003e a: something;\n\u003e If something is dead, we need to add a: to dead graph too, but \n\u003e it won\u0027t happen in this case.\n\nWhy does it matter if the label is part of the dead graph? The only user of getDeadNodes() is ReturnChecker.getDeadBlocks(), which checks whether a return statement, or the last statement in the function, is dead. It will not be a label in either of the cases.\n\n\u003e The other issue technically \"start\" MUST be added to the graph \n\u003e always, because it is a start node. If I am traversing from it, \n\u003e there is nothing in result set yet, and this would just abort...\n\nI\u0027m not sure I follow this part. This function is only used for collecting dead nodes. The starting point for the collection is not the start node of the function, it\u0027s the nodes in ControlFlowGraph.deadNodes.",

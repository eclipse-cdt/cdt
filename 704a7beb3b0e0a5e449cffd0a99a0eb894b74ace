      "message": "Please explain something to me, AFAIU how this is working and improving performance is that it relies on fCommandForCoresCache to cache the `-list-thread-groups i1` so that the multiple calls to getExecutionData for each thread now can use the cached result of the first call?\n\nI was originally going to ask you to look at org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb.service.GDBRunControl_7_0_NS.refreshThreadStates() too, but if the above is true, then there would be no advantage in the Nonstop case in changing to -list-thread-groups?\n\nThis change looks good to me pending answering the various questions I have. The tests pass (on GDB 10) so that is good too.",

      "message": "This is just a minor thing, but I am not sure why this part of the change? The only reason I can see to change it is so that the error message is \"Could not get thread info\" - but that loses the error that fCommandForCoresCache.execute may have added.\n\nNote that the handleCompleted at line 159 is different as in that case even if fCommandForCoresCache.execute fails, the getExecutionData. FTR I am not sure what is done at line 159 is a good idea.",

      "message": "UDL suffixes are already colored by OverloadedOperatorHighlighting, regardless of whether they are keywords or not.\n\nThis happens without any special logic in OverloadedOperatorHighlighting, because a use of a UDL operator gets an IASTImplicitName which resolves to the operator. (Open Declaration on the suffix works for the same reason too.)\n\nSo I don\u0027t think we need to add anything here, except perhaps a testcase to SemanticHighlightingTest to verify that a keyword suffix is correctly colored as an overloaded operator.",

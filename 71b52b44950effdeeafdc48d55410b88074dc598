      "message": "Hi @Torbj√∂rn\n\nPreviously, the USER_OBJS and LIBS were appended to the linker command within GnuMakefileGenerator.populateObjectsMakefile() in a hard-coded manner. We are no-longer doing this.\n\nPreviously, the default command line pattern for a tool did not include ${EXTRA_FLAGS} but now it does.\n\nAny existing XML toolchain description which uses GnuMakefileGenerator and overrides the linker tool command line pattern will provide an alternative command line pattern based on the assumption that USER_OBJS and LIBS will be appended by the generator.\n\nI believe any existing XML toolchain description which does NOT use the GnuMakefileGenerator will be unaffected by the change to the default command line pattern. ${EXTRA_FLAGS} should evaluate to the empty string.\n\nSo it seems reasonable for the modified GnuMakefileGenerator to identify the linker tool (using the same technique as previously used), inspect the command line pattern for the linker tool and append USER_OBJS and LIBS if that pattern does not include \"${EXTRA_FLAGS}\". This will restore legacy behaviour.\n\nAre there any other scenarios to consider?",

      "message": "This gerrit does not touch the inclusion of LIBS or USER_OBJS on the command line. All it does it avoid generating the objects.mk that defines the content of the symbols. If the tool still has references to any of the two make symbols, then they will still be added to the command line, but make will resolve them to nothing.\n\nThe content of these two symbols are mapped by the XML magic, so there is no code that does anything particular on a tool that is a linker.\n\n\nIf it\u0027s acceptable that there is *no* way to remove the ${EXTRA_FLAGS} from the command line defined on a tool, we can easily append it if it\u0027s not there already. All that is needed for this \"fix\" is adding 3 lines of code in the Tool#getCommandLinePattern() method.\n\n\nMy main concern here is how to identify a usage where the implementation does not want the ${EXTRA_FLAGS} part, for some reason, from a legacy implementation where it was not available.\nLet\u0027s discuss this during the meeting tomorrow.",

      "message": "Regarding compatibility with legacy toolchain descriptions:\n* Consumers of the older public GnuMakefileGenerator are not affected\n* The modified GnuMakefileGenerator is internal and fairly new so arguably reasonable to modify\n* The modified ManagedCommandLineGenerator is API and typically extended rather than replaced\n* The main area of concern is toolchain descriptions which override the default command line pattern or where a user has overridden this within a project. Within the modified GnuMakefileGenerator, I think we could detect the case where a tool is providing \"extra flags\" but the command line pattern does not include \"${EXTRA_FLAGS}\" and append the extra flags to the command line.",

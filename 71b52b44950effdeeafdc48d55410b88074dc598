It is working well for new projects.\n\u003e \n\u003e How to we support existing CDT managed build projects that use the gnu2/GnuMakefileGenerator but have modified the command line pattern?\n\u003e \n\u003e There is also the case of 3rd party toolchain descriptions that use the gnu2/GnuMakefileGenerator but provide their own command line pattern for the linker.\n\u003e \n\u003e It seems we need to detect whether the effective command line pattern contains \"${EXTRA_FLAGS}\" and process appropriately.\n\nI have not forgotten this topic.\nI just returned from a few weeks of vacation and am slowly getting back on track again. I will have to think a bit about the concerns you raised above. I hope I will have an answer for you this week.",

      "message": "That is probably how I would do it - it revives a long held problem with DSF-GDB\u0027s design though - all subclasses of GdbDebugServicesFactory need to update createCommandControl too.\n\nAn alternative to avoid that problem is to force everyone on to 1 concurrent unless they explicitly declare support for \u003e 1. That would mean no adopters have to make a change and they would get the fix.",

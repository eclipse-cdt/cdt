      "message": "This is the first version and it seems to be working. I\u0027m in progress of adding a third mechanism, thus there is some dead code. I also used some deprecated stuff and need to review the persistence mechanism, but for now I am happy that it actually works.\n\nDeprecated Drop down menu:\nThis somehow seemed more intuitive than the new method. I\u0027d appreciate some pointers on how to do it right. Especially gluing the the entries together was a bit vague. Or maybe I just didn\u0027t find the right documentation.\n\nPersistence:\nI\u0027m currently using CUIPlugin.getDefault().getPreferenceStore() as that was the most simple thing I could find. Playing around with it a bit, I really think that this setting should be project specific. So I\u0027m looking into getting a hold of an IAdaptable.\n\n",

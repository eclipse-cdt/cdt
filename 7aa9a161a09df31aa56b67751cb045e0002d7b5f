      "message": "The expected version can be \"default\", used when no specific version of GDB is provided, this case is probably very common as it does no require any launch settings and it also triggers the tests to run against GDB and then GDBSERVER.\n\nSo a check against \u0027default\u0027 will always fail. In order to make it easier for the developers, we could check for \u0027default\u0027 and fail it directly with a message guiding the user on how to specify the GDB version when running from Eclipse and Maven.\n\nAnother approach to consider is to replace the use of \u0027default\u0027 with the latest supported GDB version which can be derived from \nITestConstants.ALL_SUPPORTED_VERSIONS.\n  This would not require the specification of a GDB version in the launch configuration and it will work as today as long as the available GDB is compatible with the latest.",

      "message": "First, great catch!\nBut I think supporting the \u0027default\u0027 case is important.  We don\u0027t want to force users to have to install a different\nversion of GDB than what is on their machine, so we probably shouldn\u0027t require the latest version.\nAnd I think it is nicer to allow the user to leave the version empty or to use the string \u0027default\u0027.\nSo, I suggest that in those cases, we don\u0027t do any validation.\nThe validation will be used when the user has specified a specifc version of GDB and we run a different one.\nIs that ok with you?",

      "message": "This change feels a bit strange as we\u0027re going from code that does not need to be updated if we add a new unary type transormation, to code that does.\n\nOn the other hand, this change has the side effect of evaluating the type transformation eagerly if its argument is not dependent, which is a good thing.",

      "message": "That\u0027s true, actually there is the same situation in CPPTemplates.instantiateType. But now I came up with a separate test case from is_same that was failing before due to the problem exposed here (not evaluating the type transformation early enough) so it makes more sense to me to split this part in another commit altogether.",

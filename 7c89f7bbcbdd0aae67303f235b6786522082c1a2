The flush and refresh set states that are set anyways when the target will eventually suspend.\n\nIn addition, it is non-trivial to find out if target is suspended/running as you need to first query all running containers and then ask each container.",

      "message": "This private class name is fine.\n\nIf anything there can be a discussion about the name of the public interface. The interfaces under IDMEvent in DSF are about 50/50 in terms of including the enclosing class/interface name in the name of the interface. I am fine either way with the interface name, but in general including the enclosing class/interface name in the name of another class/interface seems a little redundant as someone can write ICommandControlService.IRefreshAllDMEvent in a bit of code that there is concern about differentiating.",

      "message": "Hi Nathan, I found a case where this returns a CPPFunctionSet. My guess is that this has something to do with overloads.\nI don\u0027t know whether it would make this change \u0027too heavy\u0027, but a very simple first test could be whether the set only contains one element and return that as a result.",

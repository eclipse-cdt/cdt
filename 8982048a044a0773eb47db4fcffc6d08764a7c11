This means that the gerrit that you submitted earlier today does not actually work on Windows, at least not when using PTY since I haven\u0027t update the implementation for Windows...\n\nAre you still working on updating winpty or should I try to get the pty.dll built in docker too?",

The library is part of vscode and theia too these days.\n\nBut I guess I better get on it as it may be broken now. I suspect that means the TM Terminal is broken on Windows.

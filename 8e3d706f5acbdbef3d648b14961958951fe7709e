      "message": "With both your patches on linux it looks good:\nhttps://i.imgur.com/SvmI7oc.png\n\nBut with neither of them the debug console looks fine.\nhttps://i.imgur.com/oxPSiSC.png\n\nAre you hitting a problem on Windows or with old GDBs? If so that is just the basic console which looks like this for me without your patches (GDB 7.6 no new-ui running on linux):\nhttps://i.imgur.com/9ecPYk6.png\nand with your patch it doesn\u0027t look any different.\n\nTherefore that confirms your suspicion, but also shows that if you do get it to work that may regress Linux with new-ui where it is already working.\n\n\n",

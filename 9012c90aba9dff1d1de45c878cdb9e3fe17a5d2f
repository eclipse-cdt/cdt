I would really like to hear your reasoning on that:\n\nI think \"false\" could be better default here in the long run. When developers start developing a new tab they are more likely to develop/test a single configuration version first. Most will stop right there and not even realize that it needs to be tested in multi-cfg mode. Exceptions ensue. Would you agree? What is your reasoning making \"true\" the default?",

      "message": "There is a problem with storing launch related data in the launch delegate. There is only one instance of a launch delegate is created for an Eclipse session. If two launches start in parallel their data will be mixed up. The only reason we haven\u0027t seen this issue yet is because we never start two launchers in parallel. I think sooner or later we will have to fix this issue. Maybe it is better to store the GDB version in GdbLaunch instead?",

      "message": "Darn, that is pretty bad.  And yes, you\u0027re right, I only see the constructor called once.  Surprisingly, the abstract base classes which are really old also use globals.  We should open a bug to clean that up.\n\nI\u0027ll fix this gGdbVersion at least, since it is new.\n\nThanks for pointing this out.",

      "message": "A recent commit has made QtLocalDebugLaunchConfigDelegate also use DsfSourceLookupDirector,\nand this QtLaunch does use GDB, so it can be made to use this new director.\nPersonally, I would make the change and not bother testing it (I assume you\nwould need to special setup).  The change is straight forward.  If you are not\ncomfortable with that, you can make the change in a different commit, and\nask Doug to review it so he can choose to verify or not.",

I\u0027m not sure it breaks behaviour,\nbut I don\u0027t think it should behave the way it does.\n1- we shouldn\u0027t be checking for children of an IMappingSourceContainer.  The mapping\n   itself is the one that loops over its children.\n2- when using the backend mapping, we never call MappingSourceContainer.getCompilationPath()\n   although that method checks that the local path of the mapping corresponds to the sourceName we received.\n   \nA possibly better approach would be to override MappingSourceContainer.getCompilationPath()\nto do the extra logic we are doing here.  Then we wouldn\u0027t need to override this method\nat all.  I haven\u0027t tried though.

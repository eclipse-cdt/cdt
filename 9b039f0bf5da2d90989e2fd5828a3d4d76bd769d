      "message": "I\u0027ve been thinking about initializing the steps this way, and although I believe it is safe, I think we could make the code easier to read by having getSteps return \u0027steps\u0027 if non-null, and initializing it if null.\n\nAnd if I really push the concern further, I guess it could be possible that this code runs and checks fAddressSizes, while the executor has another memory initialization step queued, that would fill that fAddressSizes.  I don\u0027t think it is really worth figuring out if this could really happen or not, since it is easy to run the code in getSteps().\n\nI\u0027ll post a patch to fix this since I didn\u0027t mention it before.",

I figure if it isn\u0027t done in 10 seconds after the binary is created, it is a failure.  I don\u0027t think it should wait for the full SWT timeout of 50 seconds that has been specified for other operations.  I did notice that I forgot to refresh the lines after each check since they aren\u0027t automatically refreshed in a thread, etc... so I have updated the patch.",

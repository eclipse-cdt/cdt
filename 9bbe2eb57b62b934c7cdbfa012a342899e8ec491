I thing I found a minor error on signed/unsigned handling (See line comment) but as I would like to get this into RC1 which for CDT is today I have made the modification myself. If you can review it today (Monday) that would be great. If not please review it even after I merge as we can still make a change before RC2 next Monday.\n",

(It\u0027s a very heavy-weight object - it would be like creating two editors every time the user opens one editor.)\n\nInstead, we should make BracketInserter a static class (so a BracketInserter object can be created without a CEditor object). If BracketInserter uses some non-static fields of CEditor, we should refactor it so those are passed in through the BracketInserter constructor instead.",

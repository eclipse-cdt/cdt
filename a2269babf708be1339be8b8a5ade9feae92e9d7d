      "message": "Rather than this JNI code, can this instead be moved to Java side and the configureNativeTrace just take a boolean that is assigned to trace_enabled? That would replace this large C function with (approx) this on Java side:\n\n    configureNativeTrace(Platform.getDebugBoolean(CNativePlugin.PLUGIN_ID + \"/debug/native/spawner\"))\n\n?",

      "message": "Okay, so what you suggest is to have 4 boolean values as input to configureNativeTrace()?\n\nThat would indeed be a lot simpler than this part, but I\u0027m not sure how to properly handle the situation that we would like to have one more thing to turn off or on. Would that require a version bump as the function would change or does that not affect private methods?",

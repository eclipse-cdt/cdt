      "message": "fairly minor - but I expect most of the time that the else branch is taken, i.e. running format all on multiple files (normally a whole project or folder) the files are all not dirty, so the progress monitor in this case will be quite out of whack by the end.\n\nSee case 2 of \"3.4 Skipping elements in a loop\" from https://www.eclipse.org/articles/Article-Progress-Monitors/article.html\n\nNote that FormatAllAction is one of those that really is a (very) long running operation, so it would be nice if the progress bar showed overall progress.\n\nAs I said at the top, fairly minor, and I don\u0027t know if the current progress monitor on this action is very accurate anyway.",

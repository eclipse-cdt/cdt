      "message": "This is tricky because the resulting IRegisterDMData array must keep the order of the requesting regDmcArray array.  I don\u0027t think this is a very good API.\n\nInstead, we should use IRegisters.getRegisterData multiple times.  It does seem less efficient, but that above API is not solid.\n\nYou will notice that this is how the view model in DSF handles things for other services.",

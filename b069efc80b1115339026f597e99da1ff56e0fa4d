Before we can release 10.6.1 we need to do the branch prep work - the branch is building now, but it need version bumps and compare + replace and a bunch of other stuff done to it - see https://github.com/eclipse-cdt/cdt-infra/issues/53 for the last such checklist.\n\nAs a side note - up until now we have bumped every single feature on a patch release, which has always struck me as a little overkill. It would be nice to actually only bump features that have changed, so that users are presented with a much shorter list of features. What happens now is all the CDT features show as updating, even if only a single bundle has actually changed. \n\n\n",

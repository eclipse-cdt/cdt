      "message": "This was a four character change and worked. We have a code freeze tomorrow so want to keep things to a minimum. I want to revisit this after that. This isn\u0027t really a cache since removing it breaks tests. I wonder if it should be info stored in the PDOM itself. I also want to revisit this whole design and make sure it\u0027s the right strategy. It\u0027s working but can it be simplified.",

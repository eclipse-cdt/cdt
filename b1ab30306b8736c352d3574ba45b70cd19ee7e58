      "message": "This test checks the name and resouce filters, as opposed to equalsByName which only checks the name. Therefore if the source folder being removed has filters, it will be not-equal and therefore not removed from the map.\n\nNow what is interesting about this is if you do delete a source folder with filters, it does correctly deleted. After a little bit of searching I found that there is a second implementation of this code that you have written here:\n\norg.eclipse.cdt.internal.core.settings.model.ResourceChangeHandler.RcMoveHandler.checkRemove(IPath, ICSourceEntry[])\n\nResourceChangeHandler has as its class doc:\n\nThis resource change handler notices external changes to the cdt projects and associated project storage metadata files, as well as changes to source folders.",

The old I builds are not kept indefinietely, but at least you can sort of tell when it is built against\n- the main I build is a composite repo, which means that p2 needs to download and resolve all the children repos, having a specific repo speeds things up.\n\nThere is a disadvantage, the repo needs to be updated more frequently (weekly or so).",

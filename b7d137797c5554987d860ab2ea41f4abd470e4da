      "message": "This is not ideal, for two reasons:\n\n- It\u0027s duplicating work. The work of calling listInitializationSequence() that the recursive call will do, was already done by checkImplicitConversionSequence().\n\n- It\u0027s subtly wrong. We\u0027ll call listInitializationSequence() with isDirect\u003dtrue, which will consider explicit constructors, which shouldn\u0027t be considered with an equals-initializer. checkImplicitConversionSequence(), on the other hand, correctly calls listInitializationSequence() with isDirect\u003dfalse in this case.\n\nInstead, we can just construct a ProblemBinding directly, something like \"new ProblemBinding(null, typeId, ISemanticProblem.BINDING_AMBIGUOUS_LOOKUP, getConstructors())\".",

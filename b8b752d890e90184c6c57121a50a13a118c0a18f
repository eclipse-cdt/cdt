      "message": "a[1] is equivalent to *(a + 1) and cannot be considered a write access for the pointer variable a. This strict semantics of \"write access\" matches the needs of Extract Function refactoring. It is possible to add a separate implementation of a different semantics for Mark Occurrences, but first we have to agree on that semantics and verify that it doesn\u0027t lead to contradictions.",

      "message": "That sounds familiar :)\nWe are using a lot of pointers and dynamic arrays in our code and accessing the content with the * operator is very common. I use the feature \"Mark write occurrence\" very often to see where a variable is accessed for writing during a debug session. In this circumstances \"write occurrence\" on pointers means every change. It can be the pointer itself or the value it points to.\nTherefore I would welcome a separate implementation of VariableReadWriteFlags for Mark Occurrences. I think it has a different goal then refactoring.",

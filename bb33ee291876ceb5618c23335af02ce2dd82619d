Probably unlikely though so not going to object to your version, just want to be sure this has been considered.\n\nI\u0027ve already pushed a version to https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/131319/ which just ignores the two specific instances, however I will remove that part from my change if this version is merged.",

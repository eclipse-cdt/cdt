      "message": "I can\u0027t find a better background color than black that will work for all the various foreground colors used in the C/C++ editor.\nIn the light theme, text is almost always with black color and then the background can be a wide range. For dark theme, the text color can be white, grey, orange, blue, ... so it\u0027s hard to find a background color that is not grey that work for all of them...\nWDYT? Is black goo enough as a default value or do you have a better color in mind?\nOnce merged, I\u0027ll cherry-pick to 10.6.2 too.",

Perhaps they don\u0027t have as many garish foreground colours to deal with.\n\nI won\u0027t have time to spin this up today, but if you add a screenshot then I can look at it if you want.",

      "message": "Some of the output from ld cannot be back-tracked to a file and then the resource will be the project (IProject instance).\nIf my memory serves me right, I think this line was the one from the test case I wrote:\n(.text.myfunc+0x42): undefined reference to `bar\u0027\n\nI think this kind of line will be generated if there is no debug symbols in the object file that is included in the linkage but is missing some other symbol.\nI can spend some time and try to create a simple project that will end up with this behavior if you think it\u0027s needed.\n\nA friend of mine talked about the problem a while ago, but I did not get more into detail than that the line was not recognized by the pattern rule.",

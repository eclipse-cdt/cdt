      "message": "I spent a few hours trying to find the definition for what tokens were allowed in a symbol, but I did not find any.\nAccording to the bug, [ and ] are allowed and so is an extra dot (.) to the set of \\w, but I do not know what other characters that might be allowed or not allowed. Therefor, I tried to allow everything other than a + sign and whitespace since I thought those were unlikely allowed in a symbol.\nI still think it\u0027s safe to assume that the symbol name should start with a dot so that we do not match generic messages from ld.\n\nMaybe your simplified expression is safe, but I have no idea. What I do know is that \\w is not enough to support C++ mangling and how sections are typically used in embedded. Could your expression be fine in a non greedy match perhaps?",

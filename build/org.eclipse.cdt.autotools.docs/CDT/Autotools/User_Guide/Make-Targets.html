		<h1 id="Make_Targets">Make Targets</h1>
		<p>A Makefile has a set of targets that can be built.  Typically, every Makefile has an 
			<b>all</b> target which builds all targets, but there may be optional targets as well.  A CDT Makefile project enables one to invoke the various make targets via the Make Targets dialog.  Since an Autotools project is a form of Makefile project, it too supports the Make Targets dialog.
			Make Targets are important for an Autotool project because there are a large number of make targets added to the Makefile automatically by configuration.  Typically, a project is built by running 
			<b>make all</b>, but it is installed by invoking 
			<b>make install</b>.  The install target places files in standard locations; usually system directories on a Linux system.  For example, header files would be installed in /usr/include and made available to all users of the system.  The install prefix (/usr) can be overridden using the configure --prefix parameter or else by specifying prefix=xxxx on the call to make (e.g. make install prefix=/my/local/directory) so that testing can be performed without modifying the whole system.
		</p>
		<p>A regular CDT Makefile project requires users to add their own Make Targets, however, the Autotools plug-in analyzes the top-level Makefile for you and creates top-level Make Targets for the project.  As mentioned, these automatically added targets can be numerous.  If you wish to create targets to run in sub-directories of the main build directory, you must add these manually.  For example, you might wish to build docs in a lower-level sub-directory, but not for the entire project.</p>
		<p>The Make Targets dialog can be displayed in two ways:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Selecting a file or folder in a project and clicking on the Project -&gt; Make Target menu item</li>
			<li>Right clicking on a file or folder in a project and selecting Make Target</li>
		</ol>
		<p>This brings up a sub-menu containing Create... and Build.... to either create a new Make Target or build an existing Make Target, respectively.</p>
		<p>

		</p>
		<p>Creating a Make Target is relatively straight-forward:</p>
		<p>
			<img border="0" src="images/AutotoolsCreateMakeTarget.png"/>
		</p>
		<p>There is nothing different in the Make Target dialog for Autotools, however, a few concepts need to be clarified.</p>
		<p>For Make Targets added as part of the Project -&gt; Make Target menu item, the target is for the top-level Makefile for the current build.  This means that if you add a Make Target this way, it will persist across configurations and will try and run the 
			<b>make</b> command in the top-level build location specified for the active configuration.
		</p>
		<p>Make Targets added by using the right-click Make Target menu are location sensitive.  This means that the 
			<b>make</b> command will attempt to run in that directory where the right-click was performed, regardless of whether there is a Makefile present there.  Let's say you want to add your own Make Target that performed a 
			<b>make all install</b> (i.e. you want to group multiple targets together into one).  If you are in configuration X with build directory build-X, you want to right-click in a directory that is build-X or a sub-directory of build-X.  This target will issue a 
			<b>make all install</b> in that particular directory.  If you wanted the same target for another configuration, you would have to right-click in its build directory or lower and add another Make Target.  Obviously, for top-level Make Targets, using the Project -&gt; Make Target menu item makes the most sense since it applies to all configurations.  If you add a Make Target to a source directory, it will likely fail when run because it will try and run 
			<b>make</b> in that directory which will probably only contain a Makefile.in or Makefile.am file and not a Makefile which is only generated at configure time.
		</p>
		<p>The Make Target dialog can be used to override various flags within the Makefile.  For example, to perform a 
			<b>make install</b> and reset the prefix to /my/local/directory, you would first select the 
			<b>install</b> target from the Build... dialog.
		</p>
		<p>
			<img border="0" src="images/AutotoolsBuildMakeTarget.png"/>
		</p>
		<p>Then, you would click the Edit button to edit the Make Target.  You can then override the prefix by specifying its value after the 
			<b>make</b> command.  You edit the build command by first un-checking "Use Builder Settings" which enables text entry.
		</p>
		<p>
			<img border="0" src="images/AutotoolsModifyMakeTarget.png"/>
		</p>
		<p>The check-box that says "Run all project builders" should be left un-checked.  By default, we only want the CDT Makefile builder to run and not the Autotools configure builder or any other builder.</p><hr class="navigation-separator"/>

/**
 * @since 3.1
 *
 * A Tool dependency calculator must implement this interface.  This interface
 * replaces IManagedDependencyGenerator which is deprecated.
 *
 * Discussion of Dependency Calculation:
 *
 * There are two major, and multiple minor, modes of dependency calculation
 * supported by the MBS.  The major modes are:
 *
 *  1. The build file generator invokes tool integrator provided methods
 *     that calculate all dependencies using whatever method the tool
 *     integrator wants.  The build file generator then adds the dependencies
 *     to the build file using the appropriate build file syntax.
 *     This is a TYPE_CUSTOM dependency calculator as defined below.
 *     See the IManagedDependencyCalculator interface for more information.
 *
 *  2. The build file generator and the tool-chain cooperate in creating and
 *     using separate "dependency" files.  In this case, dependency calculation
 *     is done at "build time", rather than at "build file generation time" as
 *     in mode #1.  This currently supports the GNU concept of using .d files
 *     in GNU make.
 *     This is either a TYPE_BUILD_COMMANDS dependency calculator or a
 *     TYPE_PREBUILD_COMMANDS dependency calculator as defined below.
 *     See the IManagedDependencyCommands and IManagedDependencyPreBuild
 *     interfaces for more information.

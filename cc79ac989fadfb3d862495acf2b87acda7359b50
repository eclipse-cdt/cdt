      "message": "@Torbjörn, it seems that any legacy objects.mk files will be ignored as soon as the top-level makefile is regenerated. Should we consider deleting legacy objects.mk as part of project clean?\n\nWe are in control of the test cases, so we can ensure that they support the latest makefile generator. Is it the case that there are many changes required?",

      "message": "I was just thinking that the XML still like refers to USER_OBJS and LIBS and then the symbols will not be defined in make. Maybe this is okay, maybe it\u0027s a problem - I don\u0027t know.\n\nAnyway, it\u0027s every project in the test bundle that needs to be touched if we remove the file, but I suppose it could be handled via a script or something.\n\nDo you still think it\u0027s best to remove the objects.mk file? If so, I\u0027ll do it :)\n\nRegarding the other errors for PS7; I have no clue why this change would cause a NPE in ManagedCommandLineGeneratorTest.java on, for example, line 78... It\u0027s almost like the ManagedCommandLineGenerator class cannot be instantiated, but that should from OOM exception instead?",

      "message": "@Torbj√∂rn, it seems that any legacy objects.mk files will be ignored as soon as the top-level makefile is regenerated. Should we consider deleting legacy objects.mk as part of project clean?\n\nWe are in control of the test cases, so we can ensure that they support the latest makefile generator. Is it the case that there are many changes required?",

      "message": "Yes, I tested locally and it went through twice on Hudson. Just to be clear, I was debating whether or not to override the timeout by using the property (-Dindexer.timeout) but that would mean polluting the pom.xml files and possibly the Hudson job configurations. There\u0027s also the fact that I\u0027ve seen the indexer time out and fail tests randomly on a very good local machine (and from within Eclipse!). So instead of having everyone have to override this property, I think it\u0027s easier to just increase the default to a somewhat high value and it can still be overridden to something even higher in the case of debugging the tests for a long period.",

      "message": "This can be seen has a time out, not a delay so it\u0027s not longer unless the Hudson instance is under heavy load then the tests can take up to 300 sec to index then fail. The whole build aborts after 180 mins anyway (in the job configuration). So this just gives the tests that depend on the index more chance to succeed even when Hudson is busier than usual.\n\nSee https://hudson.eclipse.org/cdt/job/cdt-verify/423/",

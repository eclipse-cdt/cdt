      "message": "Yes, I tested locally and it went through twice on Hudson. Just to be clear, I was debating whether or not to override the timeout by using the property (-Dindexer.timeout) but that would mean polluting the pom.xml files and possibly the Hudson job configurations. There\u0027s also the fact that I\u0027ve seen the indexer time out and fail tests randomly on a very good local machine (and from within Eclipse!). So instead of having everyone have to override this property, I think it\u0027s easier to just increase the default to a somewhat high value and it can still be overridden to something even higher in the case of debugging the tests for a long period.",

problem.name.AssignmentInCondition = Assignment in condition
checker.name.StatementHasNoEffect = StatementHasNoEffectChecker
problem.description.StatementHasNoEffect = Finds statements like 'a;' or '-a;' or 'a-b;' which do no seems to have any side effect therefore suspicious

problem.name.NonVirtualDestructor = Class has a virtual method and non-virtual destructor
checker.name.CatchByReference = CatchByReferenceChecker
problem.description.CatchByReference = Catching by reference is recommended by C++ experts, "Throw by value, catch by reference". For one thing, this avoids copying and potentially slicing the exception.

problem.name.CatchByReference = Catching by reference is recommended
checker.name.SuggestedParenthesis = SuggestedParenthesisChecker

problem.name.FormatString = Format String Vulnerability
checker.name.AssignmentToItself = Assignment to itself
problem.messagePattern.AssignmentToItself = Assignment to itself ''{0}''
problem.name.AssignmentToItself = Assignment to itself
problem.description.AssignmentToItself = Finds expression where left and right sides of the assignment are the same, i.e. 'var = var'
checker.name.ReturnStyle = Return with parenthesis
problem.name.ReturnStyle = Return with parenthesis
problem.messagePattern.ReturnStyle = Return statement has invalid style. Return value should be surrounded by parenthesis
problem.description.ReturnStyle = Checks for return statements that do no return the value in parenthesis. For example 'return 0;'  
checker.name.SuspiciousSemicolon = Suspicious semicolon
problem.name.SuspiciousSemicolon = Suspicious semicolon
problem.messagePattern.SuspiciousSemicolon = Suspicious semicolon
problem.description.SuspiciousSemicolon = A semicolon is used as a null statement in a condition. For example, 'if (expression);'
checker.name.CaseBreak = No break at end of case

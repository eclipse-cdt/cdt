/**
 * <p> A working copy of a C element acts just like a regular element (handle),
 * except it is not attached to an underlying resource. A working copy is not
 * visible to the rest of the C model. Changes in a working copy's buffer are
 * not realized in a resource. To bring the C model up-to-date with a working
 * copy's contents, an explicit commit must be performed on the working copy.
 * Other operations performed on a working copy update the contents of the
 * working copy's buffer but do not commit the contents of the working copy.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Note: The contents of a working copy is determined when a working
 * copy is created, based on the current content of the element the working
 * copy is created from. If a working copy is an <code>ICFile</code> and is
 * explicitly closed, the working copy's buffer will be thrown away. However,
 * clients should not explicitly open and close working copies.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The client that creates a working copy is responsible for
 * destroying the working copy. The C model will never automatically destroy or
 * close a working copy. (Note that destroying a working copy does not commit it
 * to the model, it only frees up the memory occupied by the element). After a
 * working copy is destroyed, the working copy cannot be accessed again. Non-
 * handle methods will throw a <code>CModelException</code> indicating the
 * C element does not exist.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * A working copy cannot be created from another working copy.
 * Calling <code>getWorkingCopy</code> on a working copy returns the receiver.
 * </p>
 * @noextend This interface is not intended to be extended by clients.
 * @noimplement This interface is not intended to be implemented by clients.

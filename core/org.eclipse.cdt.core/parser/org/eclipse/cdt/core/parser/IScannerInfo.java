	 * /System/Library/Frameworks/__framework__.framework/PrivateHeaders/__header__
	 * would handle the framework search for '/System/Library/Frameworks'
	 * <br> The variables are handled only, if a search path element makes use of both of
	 * the variables. The __framework__ variable will receive the first segment of the include,
	 * the __header__ variable the rest. Such a search path element is not used for directives
	 * with a single segment (e.g. 'header.h')

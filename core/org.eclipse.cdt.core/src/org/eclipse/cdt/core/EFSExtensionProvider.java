/**
 * Abstract class providing the basis for supplementary support classes that can extract meaningful
 * information from and provide useful operations on EFS filesystems. This allows for operations that can
 * operate on virtual EFS filesystems (where IFileStores are just links to other IFileStores), or that operate
 * on the physical file backed by an IFileStore, without having to know the implementation details of a given
 * EFS filesystem.
 * 
 * Provides a default implementation that assumes that URIs for the given filesystem map directly to resources
 * in the physical filesystem, and that the path component of the URI is a direct representation of the
 * absolute path to the file in the physical filesystem.
 * 
 * Clients wishing to support a filesystem with different behaviour should extend this class and override its
 * methods where appropriate.
 * 
 * Clients should not typically call methods on this class or its descendants directly. Instead, they should
 * call the appropriate method in FileSystemUtilityManager so that said manager can properly route calls to
 * the proper utility, depending on the filesystem.
 * 
 * <strong>EXPERIMENTAL</strong>. This class or interface has been added as part of a work in progress. There
 * is no guarantee that this API will work or that it will remain the same. Please do not use this API without
 * consulting with the CDT team.

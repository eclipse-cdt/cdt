	This mini-patch gets rid of unnecessary "could not locate type" error
	dialogs.

	- fix for bug #66108 (C++ browser cannot show members of class)
	- all types now visible in the types view (ie not just classes & structs)
	- runnables now use IProgressService.busyCursorWhile (prevents progress
	dialog from being displayed during short operations)

/**
 * <p>
 * The protocol for working set configurations. A working set configuration specifies, at a minimum, a
 * {@linkplain ICConfigurationDescription build configuration} for each C/C++ project in the working set.
 * {@linkplain #activate() activating} the configuration applies these build configurations to the respective
 * projects as their active build configurations.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Implementations of this interface may choose to manage more configuration settings than are captured by the
 * active build configuration. They are, then, responsible for persistence, editing, and application of these
 * settings.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * A working set configuration is considered to be {@linkplain #isActive() active} if all of the projects in
 * the working set are configured to build according to the configuration specified by the working set
 * configuration. It is an implementation detail (i.e., unspecified) what it means for a working set that has
 * recorded settings for projects that are not currently {@linkplain IResource#isAccessible() accessible} in
 * the workspace. However, for projects that are accessible and are included in the working set, but for which
 * the working set configuration has no settings, such projects are implicitly in the working set
 * configuration and it specifies their current configuration settings. Thus, in the extreme case, a
 * working-set configuration that includes none of the projects that currently are members of the working set,
 * is active.

      "message": "What I try to say is that tool.getPrimaryOutputType does not make sense because the data modal allows for more than 1 primary output type. However I think I\u0027m the first one to need multiple primary output types so for all actual implementations there is no difference.\n\ngetPrimaryOutputType is used in several locations so I assume all these cases do not cater for the multiple primary output type which is not \"strange\" as there is no unit test that does test this.\n\nAs for my purposes I do not need to change this. In other words my copy of GnuMakefileGenerator contains the same code.\n\nTherefore I consider this a none-urgent issue at the architectural level so I don\u0027t feel entitled to \"approve\" this change(or at least not approve \"how to change\" given backwards compatibility and my lack of java knowledge in this domain).",

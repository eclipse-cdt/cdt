      "message": "You are correct! In reality, there is no difference since sizeof(buff[0])\u003d\u003d1, but I removed the division to be more clear on this. Thanks for pointing that out!\n\nFor the sprintf_s part, sure, it is supposed to be characters, and again, sizeof(char)\u003d\u003d1, so no problem here. Could be a problem if buff is changed to wchar_t, but is that likely to happen? What other parts of the code would break then?\nWhat would you like me to do here? Add the division to make sure it\u0027s /elements/ in the array?",

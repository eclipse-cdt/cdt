<h1>C/C++ projects</h1>

<p>Normally, before you can work with plug-ins provided by the CDT, you must create an Eclipse project to store your 
source code, makefiles, binaries, and related files.  However, when you use the Stand-alone Debugger, a project is created
for your executable automatically (usually the <strong>Executables</strong> project if only dealing with one executable).
The project created on your behalf just contains the executable and links to the source files specified in the debug
info.  In most cases, you do not need to know about the project to debug, but if you wish to see the various files used
and browse them directly with the editor, you can find the project in the C/C++ Projects view.  While you are allowed to import
files into the C/C++ project, this action is normally used for adding files to a project that can build.  Since the Stand-alone
Debugger does not contain CDT (C/C++ Developer Tools) build capability, adding files does nothing to aid in debugging and can
confuse the indexer if the source has errors in it.</p>

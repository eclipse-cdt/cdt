<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>The Stand-alone Debugger is an Eclipse application which packages the
Eclipse plug-ins from the CDT (C/C++ Development Tools) project into an
application that can be started from a command-line script.  The debugger
removes some of the plug-ins that would be found in the full CDT set that
are related to building and project set-up.  This simplifies the UI for
the end-user who is only interested in debugging and is not interested in
using Eclipse to build the application itself.</p>
<p>In addition, the Stand-alone debugger helps to simplify debugging in that
it hides Eclipse-specific concepts such as the Eclipse project and launch
configuration.  While these concepts are hidden, they still are used underneath
and an experienced Eclipse user can still access them.  Subsequent documentation
here will attempt to point out where such concepts are being automated by the
Stand-alone Debugger and how they can still be accessed.</p>

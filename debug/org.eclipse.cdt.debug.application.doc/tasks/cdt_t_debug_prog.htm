<div role="main"><h1>Debugging a program</h1>

<p>To debug a program, a debug launch configuration is used.  The debug configuration contains information
such as the executable being debugged, how to run the executable, and parameters for the debugger itself (in this
case: gdb).  Once a launch configuration is created, it can be used again (e.g. relaunching the executable after
the debug session is terminated).  By default, the Stand-alone Debugger creates a debug launch configuration for
you when you specify an executable on the command-line or if you use the <strong>New Executable...</strong> dialog.</p>
<p>There are multiple debug launch configuration types.  The most common, is the Local C/C++ Application configuration
which is for running local applications and this is the configuration that the Stand-alone Debugger will set up
for you when you specify an executable in either of the aforementioned ways.

A local C/C++ launch configuration is normally tied to an Eclipse project which
contains the executable you wish to debug.  You do not have to create an Eclipse project because the Stand-alone debugger also creates the Eclipse project on your behalf as part
of importing your executable.  By default, this is usually the special <strong>Executables</strong>project which is set aside for this purpose, but if you have imported multiple
executables at the same time, additional <strong>ExecutablesNNNN</strong> projects will be created to keep each executable
in a separate project.  This is done to help the indexer keep track of the executable and all its associated source fiels.</p>
<p>There are other C/C++ debug configuration types that you may wish to use such as:
<ul>
<li>C/C++ Attach to Application</li>
<li>C/C++ Postmortem Debugger</li>
</ul>
<p>These additional launch configurations require that you create them manually.  To do this:</p>

<ol>
  <li>In  C/C++ Projects view, select a project.  The C/C++ Projects view is not visible by default when you
  start the Stand-alone debugger.  You can access it
  by using <strong>Window &gt; Show View &gt; C/C++ &gt; C/C++ Projects</strong>.  As mentioned, in most cases,
  you will only see the <strong>Executables</strong> project.
  </li>
  <li>Click <strong>Run &gt; Debug Configurations...</strong>.</li>
  <li>In the Debug Configurations dialog box, select a desired debug configuration type from the <strong>Configurations</strong> 
  list.</li>
  <li><p>Click the <strong>New</strong> button in the top left.</p></li>
  <li>In the <strong>Name</strong> box, type a descriptive name for this debug configuration.</li>
  <li>In the <strong>Project</strong> box, type the name of the project containing 
        the application you want to debug.  If you had selected a project, this project will be filled
        in for you.  In almost all cases, this will be the <strong>Executables</strong> project.</li>
  <li>In the <strong>C/C++ Application</strong> box, type the name of the executable 
        that you want to run.  This must be an application that has been imported into the project
        or in the case of an Attach to Application configuration, this field can be empty. </li>
  <li>Click <strong>Debug</strong>.<br><br>
  <p>The debug perspective is opened and the  application window opens on 
  top.  In the case of an attach configuration, a dialog will pop up to allow you to select a running application.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>For more information:</p>
<ul><li>To specify the 
    execution arguments an application uses and the working directory for a run 
    configuration, see <a href="cdt_t_run_arg.htm">Specifying execution arguments</a>.</li><li>To set the environment variables 
    and values to use when an application runs, see <a href="cdt_t_run_env.htm">
    Setting environment variables</a></li>
  <li>To select a debugger to use when debugging an application, see
  <a href="cdt_t_run_dbg.htm">Selecting a debugger</a></li>
  <li>To specify the location of source files used when debugging a C or C++ 
  application, see <a href="cdt_t_run_source.htm">Specifying the location of 
  source files</a></li>
  <li>To specify where the run configuration is stored, how you access it and 
  what perspective to open when running an application, see
  <a href="cdt_t_run_com.htm">Specifying the location of the run configuration</a></li></ul>

<p>To use a debug configuration:</p>

<p>You can reuse a previously created debug launch configuration to debug your 
program.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Click <strong>Run &gt; Debug</strong>.</li>
  <li>In the Debug dialog box, select a debug configuration from the Configurations 
  list.</li>
  <li>Click <strong>Debug</strong>. </li>
</ol>

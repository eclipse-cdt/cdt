		<h1>Rename Refactoring</h1>
		<p>
			Use the <strong>Refactor &gt; Rename</strong> command to rename
			variables, functions, classes, methods, fields or typedefs.
		</p>
		<p>
			In an Editor window, select an item and run <strong>Refactor
				&gt; Rename...</strong> from the context menu.
		</p>

		</p>
		<p>All uses of the name are highlighted, and updated in real time
			as you type. If you want to view the preview, or change any options,
			simply click on the triangle, or press the keyboard shortcut again.
			Otherwise, the options are the same as the last time a rename
			refactoring was done.</p>
		<p>When you hit Enter, all the item's declarations, definitions
			and references will be changed to use the new name. The standard Undo
			command can be used to revert the changes, if necessary.</p>
		<p>The options can be set using a dialog box, where you can
			specify the new name, and set various options affecting how hard to
			look for uses of the name that should be updated. From there you can
			also view the Preview of the changes that will be made by the
			refactoring.</p>
		<p>

		</p>
		<p>Items to be renamed can also be selected from the Project
			Explorer window, although inline renaming is not available in this
			case, so the dialog box comes up immediately.</p>

<h1>Starting The Debugger</h2>

<p>The debugger is started from the command-line using the <strong>run-gdbstandalone.sh</strong> script.
The script contains the command-line needed to start Eclipse and to pass appropriate
parameters at start-up.  The following are the command-line options supported:

<h4>-a</h4>
<p>This option specifies that you want to attach and debug an existing executable that is running on your system.
The option will bring up a dialog which contains a list of current executables running and you may choose the
executable(s) you wish to attach to.  You also have the option of starting a new executable, if desired, but you
cannot specify a build log using this method.

<h4>-b &lt;build log&gt;</h4>
<p>This option specifies an optional build log to use for indexing the source.  The build log
is simply the output of a makefile build where the options used to compile the various source files
are displayed.  The indexer uses these options to figure out what flags and include paths were used
and thus can properly parse the code to match the executable.  The parsed tree is used to navigate
within the code to search for C/C++ elements or to calculate a call hierarchy.  If this log is
not provided, the Stand-alone Debugger has only the compiler built-ins and default include paths
to use which means it may not search properly.</p>

<h4>-e &lt;executable&gt; [args*]</h4>
<p>This option specifies an executable is being debugged and provides the path to the executable.  Following
the executable path, a user may specify optional arguments to be passed to the <strong>main</strong> method
of the C/C++ application.  If an executable is not specified (e.g. starting up the Stand-alone Debugger
with no arguments), the last valid executable used invoking the debugger (if this isn't the first invocation) 
will be offered to you via a dialog, which includes the original program arguments.  
You then have the choice of simply hitting the OK button to debug the last executable again or to change the arguments
as desired.  If the executable location you specify is invalid or no executable is specified and no previous executable exists,
a dialog will be brought up to allow you to enter the required information.</p>

<h2>Automated Set-up</h3>

<p>As mentioned, the Stand-alone Debugger will initialize Eclipse objects on your behalf on
start-up so you can immediately start debugging.  For starters, the executable you specify is
is imported on your behalf into an Eclipse
C/C++ project within the Workspace.  An Eclipse project is a virtual container object that contains folders, files, etc.  and has a particular
nature.  Folders and files may be virtual and may actually link to objects outside of the workspace.  In this particular
case, the debug info of the executable specified is used to determine the location of the source files.  Each source
file is imported in the project, virtually, via a link.  This is done so that the C/C++ indexer, which usually works on
a project being developed within Eclipse, has access to all code when it is parsing.
<p>The nature of a project determines what menus, actions, and views are valid for that project.
Menus, actions, and views that are not valid are not made visible.
This helps to remove the clutter of all contributed plug-ins to what is pertinent to the task at hand
(e.g. if the C/C++ and Java IDE plug-ins are both present, one does not want to see Java tasks when
working on a C/C++ project).  Many of the plug-ins being used in the Stand-alone debugger only
work on C/C++ projects.  In most cases, the name of the C/C++ project being used will be <strong>Executables</strong>.
This project is reserved for importing executables into the CDT without creating a project first.</p>
<p>Another Eclipse concept is the Perspective.  An Eclipse perspective is a set of views and the layout of the main Eclipse
Window.  A perspective will have a default layout and can be modified the end-user for future reference (e.g. adding or removing 
views).  For the purposes of debugging,
one should use the Debug Perspective.  The Stand-alone Debugger opens the Debug Perspective by default for you which brings
up the various views needed to debug your program.</p>
<p>To debug and executable, one needs to launch it via the debugger and to provide options both for the executable and the
debugger (in this case, GDB).  All the information required to launch and debug the executable is stored
in an Eclipse object known as a Launch Configuration.  Various plug-ins can contribute different forms of Launch Configuration
which can in turn provide UI elements for settings.  In the case of the Stand-alone Debugger, debugging an executable
results in the automatic creation of a C/C++ Local Application Launch configuration.  This just means that the particular
launch configuration is meant to be used for a local application.  This launch configuration is shared for debugging purposes
and when debugging, additional parameters are available in the UI for gdb settings (e.g. gdb path, reverse debugging).
You do not need to create a launch configuration yourself, but you may wish to edit the one created on your behalf.</p>

This product is based on the CDT Stand-alone Debugger application found in
org.eclipse.cdt.debug.application. This product can be downloaded on its own, without the rest of
the C/C++ package which makes it much smaller. It also makes it easier to use because the user only
has to launch the executable after extracting the product. For example the product can be launched
by simply running: ./cdtdebug -e ~/myproject/bin/a.out arg1 arg2

You can find more information about command-line options in
org.eclipse.cdt.debug.application/scripts/README.

Note that this product is currently only built for the more popular architecture x86 and x86_64 on
Linux, Windows and Mac.

/**
 * Line breakpoint extension that allows a breakpoint to be relocated by a
 * debugger to a valid source line.
 * <p>Clients which can determine a valid source based on debuggers symbol
 * information should call the various <code>setInstalled...</code> methods with
 * the corrected location attributes. Note, there is no <code>setInstalledSourceHandle</code>,
 * clients should call {@link ICBreakpoint#setSourceHandle(String)}.  If multiple
 * clients try to change the installed breakpoint location, the last call will
 * take precedence.  This way debuggers may update the location upon active debug
 * context change.  <br/>
 * The original breakpoint location as configured by the user can always be
 * retrieved using the <code>getRequested...</code> methods.
 * </p>
 * @since 7.2
 * @noimplement This interface is not intended to be implemented by clients.
 * @noextend This interface is not intended to be extended by clients.

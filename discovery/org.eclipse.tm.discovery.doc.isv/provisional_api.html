<h1>TM Service Discovery API Status</h1>
<h2>Provisional API</h2>
<div class="p">
<p>Although Service Discovery API has been reviewed, we want to give the 
Open Source Communitiy a chance to provide public
feedback and help further improving the APIs. Therefore,</p>

<p><b>As of Service Discovery 2.0, all API is considered provisional.</b></p>

<p>This means, that we reserve the right to change any API after 
Service Discovery 2.0 in a not backward compatible way. 
We will make every sensible effort to keep at least Source API 
Compatibility intact, but in cases where this would lead to unnecessary 
code bloat we will go with API breakage. 
All such API changes will be voted on by committers on the <a href="https://dev.eclipse.org/mailman/listinfo/dsdp-tm-dev">
dsdp-tm-dev</a> developer mailing list, and documented in a migration guide
for future releases. We expect that with Community Feedback, we'll reach a 
stable, hardened API for Service Discovery 3.0. Please give your feedback on 
<a href="https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/">Eclipse Bugzilla</a>
under category DSDP, Product Target Management.</p>

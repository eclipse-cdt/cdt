## AsciiDoc content

The Asciidoctor Maven Plugin is configured to generate an HTML file in the `html/` folder for each AsciiDoc source file (`*.adoc`) placed in the `src/asciidoc/` folder.

All AsciiDoc source files should include GitHub rendering support, as illustrated in the [example document](src/asciidoc/example.adoc).

During content development, HTML files may be generated by invoking Maven locally:

```
mvn --define jgit.dirtyWorkingTree-cdtDefault=ignore --projects org.eclipse.cdt:org.eclipse.cdt.doc.user generate-resources
```

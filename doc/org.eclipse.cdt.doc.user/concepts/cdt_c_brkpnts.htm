<h1>Breakpoints</h1>

<p>A breakpoint suspends the execution of a program at the location where the breakpoint is set.
To set a line breakpoint, right-click in the marker bar area on the left side of an editor beside
the line where you want the program to be suspended, then choose <b>Toggle Breakpoint</b>. You can 
also double-click on the marker bar next to the source code line. A new breakpoint marker appears 
on the marker bar, directly to the left of the line where you added the breakpoint. Also, the new 
breakpoint appears in the Breakpoints view list.
</p>
<p>Once set, a breakpoint can be enabled and disabled by right-clicking on its icon or by
right-clicking on its description in the <b>Breakpoints</b> view.
</p>

<ul>
<li>When a breakpoint is enabled, it causes the program to suspend whenever it is hit. 
Enabled breakpoints are indicated with a blue  
<img src="../images/icon_breakpoint_obj.gif" alt="enabled breakpoint" border="0"> circle. 
Enabled breakpoints that are successfully installed 
are indicated with a checkmark overlay.</li>
<li>When a breakpoint is disabled, it will not affect the execution of the program. 
Disabled breakpoints are indicated with a white

if <b>Stop at main() on startup</b> is enabled
on the <b>Launch Configuration</b> dialog.
To access the <b>Launch Configuration</b> dialog,
from the menu bar choose <b>Run > Debug</b>.

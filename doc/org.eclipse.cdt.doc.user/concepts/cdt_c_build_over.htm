<h1>Building C/C++ projects</h1>

<p>The CDT relies on an external make utility, such as GNU make, to build a project.  
The CDT can generate makefiles automatically when you create a Managed Make C project or a Managed Make C++ project. 
You have the option of creating a Standard Make C project or a Standard Make C++ project and providing the makefile yourself.</p>
<h2>Required utilities</h2>
<p>You must install and configure the following utilities:
<ul>
  <li>Build (e.g. make).</li>
  <li>Compile (e.g. gcc).</li>
  <li>Debug (e.g. gdb).</li>
</ul>
<b>Note: </b> while make, gcc and gdb are the examples used in the documentation, virtually any similar set of tools or utilities could be used.</p>

<p><b>Tip: </b>Cygwin contains these utilities (make, gcc and gdb) for a Windows environment, while running the cygwin installation ensure <tt>gcc</tt> and <tt>make</tt> are selected, they are not installed by default. 
For more information, see <a href="http://www.cygwin.com">http://www.cygwin.com</a>. Red Hat users, all you need to build your project is included in the Red Hat Linux installation.
For other operating systems please refer to your installation documentation.</p>
</p>

<h2>Build terminology</h2>

<p>The CDT uses a number of terms to describe the scope of the build. </p>

<h3>Build Project</h3>

<p>This is an incremental build (make all, assuming all is defined in your makefile). Only the components affected by modified files in that particular project are built.</p>

<h3>Rebuild Project</h3>

<p>Builds every file in the project whether or not a file has been modified since the last build. A rebuild is a clean followed by a build.</p>

<p>For more information on builds, see:</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Workbench User Guide &gt; Concepts &gt; Workbench &gt; Builds</b></li>
  <li><b>Workbench User Guide &gt; Tasks &gt; Building resources</b></li>
</ul>

<p>Build-related information is displayed as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The Console view displays the output of the build tools.</li>
  <li>The Tasks view displays a list of compiler errors and warnings related to your projects.</li>
  <li>Makefile targets are displayed in the Make Targets view.</li>
</ul>

<p>For more information about the Tasks view, see <b>Workbench User Guide &gt; Reference &gt; User interface information &gt; Views and editors &gt; Tasks view</b>.</p>

<h2>Getting a makefile</h2>

<p>You can either create a C/C++ project for which you supply the <b>makefile</b> or create a C/C++ project for which the CDT generates makefiles automatically.</p>

<p>To create a new project, from the menu bar choose <b>File > New > Project</b>. In the dialog that appears:</p>

<ul>
	<li>To create a project for which you supply the <b>makefile</b>, select either <b>Standard Make C project</b> or <b>Standard Make C++ project</b>. </li>
	<li>To create a project for which the CDT supplies a basic  <b>makefile</b>, select either <b>Managed Make C project</b> or <b>Managed Make C++ project</b>. </li>
</ul>

<h2>Setting build preferences</h2>

<p>You can set build preferences in Eclipse:</p>

<dl>
	<dt>Build order</dt>
		<dd>If certain projects must be built before others, you can set the <i>build order</i>. 
			If your project refers to another project, the CDT must build the other project first.
			To set the build order, from the menu bar select <b>Window &gt; Preferences &gt; Build Order</b>.
			<p>When you set the build order, the CDT does not rebuild projects that depend on a project; 
			you must rebuild all projects to ensure all changes are propagated.</p></dd>
	<dt>Automatic save</dt>
		<dd>You can set the CDT to perform an <i>automatic save</i> of all modified resources when you perform a manual build; 
			from the menu bar, select <b>Windows &gt; Preferences &gt; Workbench</b>.By default, this feature is enabled.</dd>
</dl>

<h2>Controlling the building of your project</h2>

<p>The C/C++ compiler that a project uses is controlled by the project's <b>Properties</b> setting.
To view a project's properties, right-click on the project and select <b>Properties</b>.
In the dialog that appears, the <b>C/C++ Standard Make Project</b> page enables you to control a variety of settings, including:</p>
<dl>
	<dt>Build Setting</dt>
		<dd>Controls whether the compiler will <b>Stop On Error</b>or <b>Keep Going On Error</b>.
				Choosing <b>Keep Going On Error</b> will force the compiler to attempt to build all referenced projects even if the current project has errors.</dd>
	<dt>Build Command</dt>
		<dd>Controls which make is used.</dd>
	<dt>Workbench Build Behavior</dt>
		<dd>Controls which makefile target will be built depending on the scope of the build.</dd>
</dl>

<h2>Viewing build information</h2>

<p>Build-related information is displayed as follows: </p>
<ul>
	<li>The <b>Console</b> view displays the output of the make utility.</li>
	<li>The <b>Tasks</b> view displays a list of compiler errors and warnings related to your projects.  </li>
	<li>Build actions display in the <b>Make Targets</b> view.</li>
</ul>

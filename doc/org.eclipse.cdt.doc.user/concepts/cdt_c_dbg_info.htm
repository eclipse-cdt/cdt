<h1>Debug information</h1>

<p>The <strong>Debug</strong> perspective lets you manage the debugging or running of a program 
in the Workbench. You can control the execution of your program by setting 
breakpoints, suspending launched programs, stepping through your code, and 
examining the contents of variables.</p>
<p>&nbsp;The <strong>Debug</strong> perspective displays the following information:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The stack frame for the suspended threads 
for each target that you are debugging</li>
  <li>Each thread in your program represented as a node in the tree</li>
  <li>The process for each program that you are running</li>
</ul>
<p>The <strong>Debug</strong> perspective also drives the <strong>C/C++ Editor</strong>. As you step 
through your program, the <strong>C/C++ Editor</strong> highlights the location of the 
execution pointer. </p>

<h2>Variables</h2>

<p>You can view information about the variables in a selected stack frame in the 
Variables view. When execution stops, the changed values are 
by default highlighted in red. Like the other debug-related views, the Variables view does 
not refresh as you run your executable. A refresh occurs when execution stops.</p>

<h2>Expressions</h2>

<p>An expression is a snippet of code that can be evaluated to produce a result. 
The context for an expression depends on the particular debug model. Some 
expressions may need to be evaluated at a specific location in the program so 
that the variables can be referenced. You can view information about expressions 
in the Expressions view.</p>

<h2>Registers</h2>

<p>You can view information about the registers in a selected stack frame. 
Values that have changed are highlighted in the Registers view when your program 
stops.</p>

<h2>Memory</h2>

<p>You can inspect and change your process memory.</p>

<h2>Disassembly</h2>

<p>You can view disassembled code mixed with source information.</p>

<h2>Modules</h2>

<p>You can view information about the modules (executables and shared libraries) loaded 
in the current debug session.</p>

<h2>Signals</h2>

<p>You can view the signals defined on the selected debug target and how the 
debugger handles each one.</p>

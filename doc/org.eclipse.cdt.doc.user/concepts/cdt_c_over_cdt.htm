<h1>CDT Overview</h1>
<p>The C/C++ Development Toolkit (CDT) is a set of Eclipse plug-ins that provide 
C and C++ extensions to the Eclipse workbench. For more information about 
Eclipse, see <b>Workbench User Guide &gt; Concepts &gt; Workbench</b>.</p>

<p>The CDT provides a C/C++ IDE that simplifies many of the same tools that 
you can use from the command line.  The CDT can also communicate with many external 
utilities and interpret their responses, such as:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Build (such as make).</li>
  <li>Compile (such as gcc). For more information, see
  <a href="http://gcc.gnu.org">http://gcc.gnu.org</a>.</li>
  <li>Debug (such as gdb). For more information, see
  <a href="http://sources.redhat.com/gdb/">http://sources.redhat.com/gdb/</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>The CDT opens as the C/C++ perspective of the Eclipse workbench. The 
C/C++ perspective consists of an editor and the following 
views:</p>
<dl>
	<dt>C/C++ Projects</dt><dd>Shows your C/C++ projects and files.It operates in much the same way as the <b>Navigator</b>.</dd>
	<dt>Console</dt><dd>Displays your program's output, as well as the output from your build command.</dd>
	<dt>Editor</dt><dd>The C/C++ editor view provides specialized features for editing C/C++ related files.</dd>
	<dt>Make Targets</dt><dd>Enables you to select the make targets you want to build in your workspace.</dd>
	<dt>Navigator</dt><dd>Shows all of the file system's files under your workspace directory.</dd>
	<dt>Outline</dt><dd>Displays the structure of the file currently open in an editor.</dd>
	<dt>Problems View</dt><dd>If you encounter any errors during a build they will be displayed in the Problems view.</dd>
	<dt>Properties</dt><dd>Shows the attributes of the item currently selected in a view or an editor.</dd>
	<dt>Search</dt><dd>Shows the results of searches for files or text.</dd>
	<dt>Tasks</dt>	<dd>Lists tasks that want to keep track of, either as a schedule of things 	to do or a history of things that have been done.</dd>
</dl>

<h3>CDT updates</h3>

<p>The <b>Install/Update</b> perspective provides information about your current 
Eclipse installation and provides the framework to manage your updates. For more information, see <b>Workbench User Guide &gt; Tasks &gt; Updating 
  features with the update manager</b>.</p>

<h1>Views in the C/C++ perspective</h1>

<p>The C/C++ views are panels that help you perform the tasks involved in creating C/C++ programs.
The <a href="cdt_c_perspectives.htm">C/C++ perspective</a> displays these panels in a single Eclipse window. </p>

<strong>Changing Views:</strong> 
<ul>
	<li>You can add views to a perspective. From the menu bar choose  <strong>Window > Show View > Other</strong> and select a new view from the Show View dialog.</li>
	<li>To reset the current perspective to its original layout, from the menu bar choose  <strong>Window > Reset Perspective</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<p>The following views are commonly used in the <strong>C/C++</strong> perspective:</p>

<dl>
	<dt>Project Explorer</dt><dd>Shows all of the file system's files under your workspace directory.</dd>
	<dt>Console</dt><dd>Displays your program's output, as well as the output from your build tools.</dd>
	<dt>Editor</dt><dd>The C/C++ editor view provides specialized features for editing C/C++ related files.</dd>

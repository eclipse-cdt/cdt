							<li><b>Back</b>:&nbsp; This command displays the hierarchy that was displayed immediately prior to the current display.&nbsp; 
									For example, if you Go Into a resource, then the Back command in the resulting display returns the view to the same hierarchy from which you activated the Go Into command.&nbsp; 
									This command is similar to the Back button in an HTML browser.</li>
							<li><b>Forward</b>:&nbsp; This command displays the hierarchy that was displayed immediately after the current display.&nbsp; 
									For example, if you've just selected the Back command, then selecting the Forward command in the resulting display returns the view to the same hierarchy from which you activated the 
									Back command.&nbsp; This command is similar to the Forward button in an HTML browser.</li>
							<li><b>Up one level</b>:&nbsp; This command displays the hierarchy of the parent of the current highest-level resource.</li>
							<li><B>Resource</B>: This command allows you to navigate quickly to a resource. For more information see the links to related tasks below.</li>

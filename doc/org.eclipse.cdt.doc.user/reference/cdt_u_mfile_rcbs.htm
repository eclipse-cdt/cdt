<h1>C/C++ Project Properties, Managed Make File,  C/C++ Build, Custom Build Steps</h1>
Customizes the selected build configuration allowing the specification of a user defined build command step
for the selected file.  In addition to the build command, the user may specify any additional input file(s)
dependencies, the output file(s) generated by the build step, a descriptive message to be displayed in the
build output when the command is executed, and a rule for how the custom build step should be applied with
respect to other tools defined in the configuration, if any.  Custom build steps may be specified for any
file type, regardless of the project nature.

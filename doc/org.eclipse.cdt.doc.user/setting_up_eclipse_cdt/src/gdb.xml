  <title>GDB (optional!)</title>
  <para>This section is completely optional. You may skip it and go
        directly to <xref linkend="msys"/>.</para>
  <para>If you want to use the debugger, you may have to install it
        separately. This is the case with MinGW 5.0.2, it may be different in
        other versions. Download it from the same page, look for a package
        starting with gdb and ending with .exe. At the time of this writing
        (Apr 29) the current version was "gdb-5.2.1-1.exe". Install
        (double-click) that .exe, select all the default options (make sure
        you select the same MinGW directory as you did during the MinGW
        install).</para>
  <para>I have received a report that gdb-6.3-2 does not work. So I
        would advise using the older version or waiting for a newer
        one.</para>
  <para>Checkpoint:</para>
  <programlisting>gdb --version</programlisting>
  <para>should print the gdb version. This is optional.</para>

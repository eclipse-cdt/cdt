First, you need to download MinGW. You can either click through the websites mentioned above or go directly to the [https://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw/files/ MinGW download area]. Look for the Section &quot;Automated MinGW Installer&quot;, then &quot;mingw-get-inst&quot;. There, download the newest subdirectory. and in there download the file ending in .exe. The file name should be something like &quot;mingw-get-inst-20110802.exe&quot;. You can also download [http://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw/files/Automated%20MinGW%20Installer/mingw-get-inst/mingw-get-inst-20110802/mingw-get-inst-20110802.exe/download mingw-get-inst-200110802.exe] from the link given here.

Make sure you install the program with Administrator Priviledges. Right-click on the downloaded file, and select &quot;Run as Administrator&quot;.

On the next screen, you again have to change things. You have to select &quot;C++Compiler&quot; and &quot;MSYS Basic System&quot;. These two are necessary to run the compiler and the build-system on Windows.

Once the installation is complete, hit &quot;Finish&quot;.

Checkpoint: You should be able to start MSYS by going to Start / Programs / MinGW / MinGW Shell. A console window should open. There, the following commands should give you some output:

<pre>gcc --version
g++ --version
make --version</pre>
Close the MSYS shell again. We'll make sure that these tools are available for all Windows programs in the next section.

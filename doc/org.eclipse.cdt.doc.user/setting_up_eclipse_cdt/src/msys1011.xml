  <title>MSYS 1.0.11</title>
  <para>Unfortunately MinGW is not enough. We also need the MSYS tools
        from the same download page. Go there again, to the "Current" section
        and look for "MSYS Base System". Again, look for the file ending in
        .exe, as this time: "MSYS-1.0.11.exe". You may have to expand the
        "Release Candidate" section. Or you may use the link here to <link xlink:href="http://downloads.sourceforge.net/mingw/MSYS-1.0.11.exe">MSYS-1.0.11.exe</link>.
        Download it and start it. You should get a window like this:</para>
  <figure xml:id="msys1011install">
    <title>MSYS install</title>
    <screenshot>
      <mediaobject>
        <imageobject>
          <imagedata fileref="setup1.png"/>
        </imageobject>
      </mediaobject>
    </screenshot>
  </figure>
  <para>If you accept all the default options, after a while there
        should be a black and white window, similar to this:</para>
  <figure xml:id="msys1011postinstall">
    <title>MSYS asking for post-install</title>
    <screenshot>
      <mediaobject>
        <imageobject>
          <imagedata fileref="setup9.png"/>
        </imageobject>
      </mediaobject>
    </screenshot>
  </figure>
  <para>To continue the install type in y and then Enter. The next
        question reads like this:</para>
  <figure xml:id="msys1011mingw">
    <title>MSYS asking for MinGW</title>
    <screenshot>
      <mediaobject>
        <imageobject>
          <imagedata fileref="setupa.png"/>
        </imageobject>
      </mediaobject>
    </screenshot>
  </figure>
  <para>Which you can also answer with y Enter. The next question is a
        little bit more tricky:</para>
  <figure xml:id="msys1011mingwpath">
    <title>MSYS asking for path to MinGW</title>
    <screenshot>
      <mediaobject>
        <imageobject>
          <imagedata fileref="setupb.png"/>
        </imageobject>
      </mediaobject>
    </screenshot>
  </figure>
  <para>What they want to know is where you installed MinGW to and that
        you replace all backward slashes (\) by forward slashes (/). If you
        followed the instructions, the answer here will be:</para>
  <programlisting>C:/MinGW</programlisting>
  <para>Caveat: If you have not used the default paths, but instead have
        installed MinGW in a different location, such as
        <computeroutput>C:/Program Files/MinGW</computeroutput>, where the
        path contains spaces and / or is longer than 8 characters you may have
        to replace that particular path component with its DOS short pathname,
        such as <computeroutput>C:/PROGRA~1/mingw</computeroutput>.</para>
  <para>Caveat2: The installer may be case sensitive. Please make sure
        you have written MinGW in the same capitalization as during your first
        install, in some cases you will have to enter
        <computeroutput>c:/mingw</computeroutput> (note
        capitalization!).</para>
  <para>The very last question just asks you to press a key:</para>
  <figure xml:id="msys1011correctly">
    <title>MSYS installing correctly</title>
    <screenshot>
      <mediaobject>
        <imageobject>
          <imagedata fileref="setupc.png"/>
        </imageobject>
      </mediaobject>
    </screenshot>
  </figure>
  <para>Where you can press any key you like to continue. Setup will
        come back and ask you if you want to read a welcome note and the
        README file. You probably don't want either one, but it does not hurt
        to look. Anyways, once you hit "Finish" you are done with the setup.
        Now you have to set up your Path environment variable.</para>

== Before you begin

Depending on how you obtained the CDT, you might have also received a
toolchain with a built-in CDT integration. However, if you downloaded
the CDT from the Eclipse web site, then you will require a toolchain
before you can build and debug any projects.

The standard CDT supports integration with the GNU toolchain. This
includes GNU's make, gcc compiler, and gdb debugger utilities. If you
require a toolchain to build software for your development host, this is
the best choice to get started.

Each platform that runs the CDT requires different steps to acquire this
toolchain.

=== Windows

For windows, MinGW and Cygwin are the two main platform choices for
acquiring the GNU toolchain. It is important to understand the
difference between them. Cygwin produces executables that use the Cygwin
POSIX runtime. Note that this runtime is GPL licensed. MinGW produces
native Windows executables that do not require a separate runtime.

* For *MinGW*, it is recommended to use the MSYS2 software distribution.
The CDT will automatically detect tools that are installed using the
MSYS2 package manager. Download and run the latest MSYS2 installer by
following instructions on the https://www.msys2.org/[MSYS2 Getting
Started] page. When you reach the UCRT64 environment prompt, use the
following commands to install individual tools:

|===
|Tool|Installation command|Notes

|clang
|`pacman -S mingw-w64-ucrt-x86_64-clang`
|Provides the _LLVM with Clang_ toolchain

|clangd
|`pacman -S mingw-w64-ucrt-x86_64-clang-tools-extra`
|Required by the _C/{cpp} Editor (LSP)_

|cmake
|`pacman -S mingw-w64-ucrt-x86_64-cmake`
|Required for building _CMake_ projects

|gcc
|`pacman -S mingw-w64-ucrt-x86_64-gcc`
|Provides the _MinGW GCC_ toolchain

|gdb
|`pacman -S mingw-w64-ucrt-x86_64-gdb`
|Required for local _C/{cpp} Application_ debugging using GDB (recommended)

|lldb-mi
|`pacman -S mingw-w64-ucrt-x86_64-lldb-mi`
|Required for local _C/{cpp} Application_ debugging using LLDB (experimental)

|make
|`pacman -S make`
|Required for building _Managed Build_ projects

|ninja
|`pacman -S mingw-w64-ucrt-x86_64-ninja`
|Required for building _CMake_ projects
|===

* *Cygwin* can be installed from the Cygwin site at
https://www.cygwin.com. You need to manually select the gcc, gdb, and
make packages to install the toolchain. Note that there is a
https://github.com/eclipse-cdt/cdt/issues/228[known issue] with running
recent versions of Cygwin gdb under the CDT.
* The *Windows SDK* provides the Visual {cpp} compiler and header files
and libraries required to create Windows applications. The CDT Visual
{cpp} build integration will find these files based on where you installed
the SDK. No other setup is required. +
_Note:_ For this release, the integration should be considered beta
quality. It is not recommended for production use.

=== Linux

All Linux distributions include the GNU toolchain. They may not,
however, be installed by default. For instructions about installing the
GNU toolchain for Linux, see the instructions for your particular
distribution.

=== macOS

The CDT supports the _Clang_ toolchain provided by the
_Xcode Command Line Tools_. It is recommended to use the Homebrew
software distribution for any additional tools. The CDT will automatically
detect tools that are installed using the Homebrew package manager.
Install Homebrew by following instructions on the https://brew.sh/[Homebrew]
home page. Then use the following commands at a _Terminal_ prompt to install
individual tools:

|Tool|Installation command|Notes

|cmake
|`brew install cmake`
|Required for building _CMake_ projects

|lldb-mi
|`brew install cdt-project/tools/lldb-mi`
|Required for local _C/{cpp} Application_ debugging on Apple silicon (you must also install the CDT _C/{cpp} LLDB Debugger Integration_ feature)

|ninja
|`brew install ninja`
|Required for building _CMake_ projects
|===

=== Other Platforms

The GNU toolchain is supported on all platforms that the CDT supports.
For instructions about installing the GNU toolchain on your platform,
see your platform vendor.

== Debugging a local target

Debugging a CBS project is done via the xref:cbs_launchbar.adoc[Launch Bar]. Make
sure the launch bar is installed and enabled.

First build the project for Debug.
See xref:cbs_build_project.adoc[Building a project].

. Select the launch configuration of the project you want to run.
. Select launch mode *Debug*.
. Press the *Debug* button in the launch bar.
. Confirm the switch to the Debug Perspective.

The Perspective will change to *Debug*, and you can start debugging.

=== Changing debug settings

To change debug settings:

. Set the launch mode to *Debug*
. Edit the project's launch configuration. Click on the gear icon.

The edit launch configuration wizard will open. Notice that there are
now two extra tabs *Debugger* and *Source*, because the launch mode is
*Debug*. These are not present in launch mode *Run*.

On the *Main* tab you can set an alternative C/C++ application, and
you can enable or disable build before launch.

On the *Arguments* tab you specify optional arguments, and you can
change the working directory.

On the *Environment* tab you define optional environment variables.

On the *Debugger* tab you can set an alternative debugger. If the
debugger name is not an absolute path, CDT will look first for the
debugger in the selected toolchain in the *Build Settings* tab. When
it is not found in the toolchain the debugger is searched in the
*PATH* environment variable defined locations.

On the *Source* tab extra paths outside the project folder can be
defined to look for source code.

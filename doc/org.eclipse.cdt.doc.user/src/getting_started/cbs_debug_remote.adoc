== Debugging a remote target

Debugging a CBS project is done via the xref:cbs_launchbar.adoc[Launch Bar]. Make
sure the launch bar is installed and enabled.

A new remote target must be added to the launch bar.

. Select launch mode *Debug*.
. Unfold the launch target selector by pressing the "v" symbol.
. Select *New Launch Target...*

Enter the connection details, and click *Finish*.

When the remote target is selected in the launch bar, the launch
configuration Debugger tab has an extra sub tab *Connection*.  The
Connection tab inherited the values from launch target. The fields are
disabled for editing. Changing host name or port number must be done
in the launch target. Note that the launch target can be used for
multiple launch configurations.

the fields for the connection parameters are not editable.

== Using existing code

This tutorial describes how to create a new Core Build System
(CBS) project for use with existing code.

Using existing code is done by creating a new **empty** CDT project in
the top directory containing the existing source files. CDT project
files will be created in the existing source directory.

=== Using an existing CMake project

To create an empty CMake project in CDT select the template *Empty or Existing CMake
Project* in the *New C/{cpp} Project* wizard.

In the *New CMake Project* wizard uncheck *Use default location*
and set the location of the existing code.

More information about creating a CMake project is described in
xref:new_cmake_proj.adoc[Creating a CMake project]

=== Using an existing Makefile project

Create a CBS Makefile project in CDT as described in
xref:new_cbs_makefile_proj.adoc[Creating a Core Build System Makefile project]
with the following changes:

In the *New Makefile Project* wizard uncheck *Use default location*,
set the location of the existing code, and uncheck *Create Hello
World Source and Makefile example*.

== Building a project

The make output and build progress information displays in the
xref:../reference/cdt_u_console_view.adoc[Console] view. The
xref:../reference/cdt_u_make_targets_view.adoc[Make Targets] view
displays makefile actions, and the
xref:../reference/cdt_u_problems_view.adoc[Problems] view displays
compile warnings or errors.

=== To build a project:

. In the *Project Explorer* view, select your project. For the tutorial,
you can select the *HelloWorld* project you created earlier.
+
. Click *Project > Build Project*, or click the build icon
image:hammer-icon.png[build icon] on the toolbar.
 +
+
If you see an error message, such as:
+
`(Cannot run program "make": Launching failed)`
+
then CDT cannot locate the build command, usually `make`. Either your
path is not configured correctly, or you do not have `make` installed on
your system.
 +
. You can see in the *Console* view the output and results of the build
command. Click on its tab to bring the view forward if it is not
currently visible. If for some reason it's not present, you can open it
by selecting *Window > Show View > Console*.

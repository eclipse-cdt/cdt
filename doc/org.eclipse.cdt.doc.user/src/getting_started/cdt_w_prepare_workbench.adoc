== Preparing the Workbench

This tutorial will get you started using the C/{cpp} Development Toolkit (CDT) in the Workbench.

First, you will verify that the workbench is properly configured for C/{cpp} development. It is assumed that:

- Your Workbench has its default settings. To reset the current perspective to its original layout, from the menu bar select **Window &gt; Reset Perspective**.

- You are familiar with the basic Workbench features, such as views xref:../concepts/cdt_c_views.adoc[views] and xref:../concepts/cdt_c_perspectives.adoc[perspectives]


== Setting the global editor operations and appearance

The main place to configure global editor-related preferences is the image:command_link.png[] xref:javascript:executeCommand('org.eclipse.ui.window.preferences(preferencePageId=org.eclipse.ui.preferencePages.Editors)')[General &gt; Editors] preference pages (also accessible through the **Window &gt; Preferences** menu item)


== Setting the C/{cpp} editor operations and appearance

C/{cpp}-specific editor preferences are under image:command_link.png[] xref:javascript:executeCommand('org.eclipse.ui.window.preferences(preferencePageId=org.eclipse.ui.preferencePages.Editors)')[C/{cpp} &gt; Editor].
They include the following:

- xref:../reference/cdt_u_c_editor_gen.adoc[Editor] - control the appearance of text highlighting
- xref:../reference/cdt_u_c_editor_con_assist.adoc[Content Assist] - customize the Content Assist feature
- xref:../reference/cdt_u_c_editor_folding.adoc[Folding] - customize folding behavior
- xref:../reference/cdt_u_c_editor_hov.adoc[Hovering] customize hover behavior
- xref:../reference/cdt_u_c_editor_mark_occurrences.adoc[Mark Occurrences] - set annotations
- xref:../reference/cdt_u_c_editor_save_actions.adoc[Save Actions] - configure actions performed while saving a file
- xref:../reference/cdt_u_c_editor_scalability.adoc[Scalability] - configure behavior for handling large source files
- xref:../reference/cdt_u_c_editor_color.adoc[Syntax Coloring] - specify how C/{cpp} source code is rendered
- xref:../reference/cdt_u_c_code_templates_pref.adoc[Templates] - configure the format of newly generated code stubs, comments and files
- xref:../reference/cdt_u_c_editor_typing.adoc[Typing] - configure formatting input as you type

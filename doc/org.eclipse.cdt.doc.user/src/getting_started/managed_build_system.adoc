= Using the Managed Build System

*Classic C/{cpp}* projects are based on the Managed Build System.
Managed Build projects can generate a Makefile based on GUI controlled
build configurations.

These are some key features of Classic C/{cpp} projects:

* Makefile generation by GUI controlled build configurations.
* The user can simply add source files, and the Makefile generation
  will automatically include them.
* Multiple build configurations, default _Release_ and _Debug_.
* A mode in which Makefile generation is disabled.
  For writing your own Makefile or using existing code.
* The LaunchBar is not needed.

== Creating a Core Build System Makefile project

This tutorial describes the process of creating a new C/{cpp} project that includes a Makefile file.

You need to create a project to contain your source code and related files.
A project has an associated builder that can incrementally compile source files as they are changed.

To create a project:

. Select menu:File[New > Project].
+
When you create a new project, you are required to specify the project type.
This project type will determine the toolchain, data, and tabs that the CDT uses/displays.
. Select the type of project to create. For this tutorial, expand the *C/{cpp}* folder and select *C/{cpp} Project*.
. Click btn:[Next].

The *C/{cpp} Project* wizard opens:

By default, the CDT presents all *C/{cpp} Project* templates.

. Select the *Make* template filter and choose from the *Makefile project* project template.

. Click btn:[Next].
. In the *Project name* field, provide a name for the new project.
. Leave the *Use Default Location* option selected.
. Select *Create Hello World Source and Makefile example* to
get a Hello World example application.
. Click btn:[Finish].
. If a message box prompts you to change perspectives, click btn:[Yes].

Your new project displays in the Project Explorer view.
Your project may be empty if you did not select the Hello World example creation.
You can now start writing the code for your application or importing code from elsewhere.

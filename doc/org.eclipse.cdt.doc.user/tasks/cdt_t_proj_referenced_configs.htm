<div role="main"><h1>Project References</h1>

<p>Project References are a powerful way of expressing dependencies between your CDT projects, allowing you to
write modular software built with CDT's managedbuild.

<p> Two main pages control project references:
<ul>
<li>
<a href="../reference/cdt_u_prop_general_pns_ref.htm">Project References Page</a> under<br>
<span class="bold">Right click > Properties > C/C++ General > Paths and Symbols</span>
</li>
<li>
<a href="../reference/cdt_u_prop_general_exp.htm">Export Settings Page</a> under<br>
<span class="bold">Right click > Properties > C/C++ General > Export Settings</span> <br>
<em>If this page is missing, enable it under Window > Preferences > C/C++ > Property Page Settings </em>
</li>
</ul>

<p>
The export settings page gives you fine grained control of which paths, preprocessor symbols, and
library files are exported by a given project's configuration.
<p>
When another project's configuration, in the workspace, references a configuration with exported settings, those settings 
are automatically propagated into the dependent project configuration.  CDT also ensures that referenced projects are
built as a prerequisite for building dependent projects.
<p>
This functionality prevents you from needing to maintain and update the build settings manually between all the
dependent projects in your workspace.  Simply configure the exported settings, setup the references, and the settings
are propagated and kept in sync for you.

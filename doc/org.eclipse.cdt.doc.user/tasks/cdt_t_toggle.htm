<div role="main"><h1>Toggle Function Definition</h1>

<p>Toggle Function Definition moves a function definition inside an C/C++ source editor from one 
position to another and preserves correctness.</p>

<p>Toggling is available whenever the cursor is inside a function declaration 
or definition. Any selection between the first and the last character of 
the function definition (without comments) is considered valid for toggling.</p>

<h2>Toggle free functions</h2>
<p>The refactoring moves free functions from an implementation file to a header file with the same name and back.
 If the header file does not exist the file is created.</p>

<h2>Toggle member functions</h2>
 <p>The function definition of a member function can by moved from the class declaration in the header file to an inline definition
  in the header file to the implementation file and back to the class definition.</p>

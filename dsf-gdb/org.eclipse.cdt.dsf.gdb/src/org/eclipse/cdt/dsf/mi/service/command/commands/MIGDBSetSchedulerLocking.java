/**
 *
 * -gdb-set scheduler-locking [on|step|off]
 *
 * Set the scheduler locking mode. If it is off, then there is no locking and any thread may run at any time.
 * If on, then only the current thread may run when the inferior is resumed. The step mode optimizes for
 * single-stepping; it prevents other threads from preempting the current thread while you are stepping, so
 * that the focus of debugging does not change unexpectedly. Other threads only rarely (or never) get a chance
 * to run when you step. They are more likely to run when you `next' over a function call, and they are
 * completely free to run when you use commands like `continue', `until', or `finish'. However, unless another
 * thread hits a breakpoint during its timeslice, gdb does not change the current thread away from the thread
 * that you are debugging.
 *

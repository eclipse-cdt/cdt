/**
 * The view model provider handles the layout of a given model within a
 * single viewer.  The View Model Adapter delegates calls for view content to
 * this object for a view that this provider handles.
 *
 * <p/>
 * A given view model provider is typically configured with a number of
 * {@link IVMNode} objects which are organized in a parent-child hierarchy.
 * The node hierarchy has a root node which is retrieved using {@link #getRootVMNode()}.
 *
 * <p/>
 * Note on concurency: The view model provider is single-threaded and it has to be
 * accessed only using the <code>Executor</code> returned by {@link #getExecutor()}.
 * The thread of this executor should be the display thread used by the viewer
 * corresponding to the view model provider.  Currently the flexible hierarchy
 * interfaces that this interface extends do not guarantee that their methods
 * will be called on the display thread, although from their use we are making
 * this assumption (bug 213629).  {@link IElementContentProvider} is an
 * exception to this, it is called by the TreeModelViewer on a background
 * thread, however it is not expected that the viewer will be calling the
 * IVMProvider directly. Rather, it is expected that the viewer will call
 * {@link IVMAdapter} which implements <code>IElementContentProvider</code>,
 * and <code>IVMAdapter</code> implementation is expected to switch to
 * provider's thread before delegating the call to it.

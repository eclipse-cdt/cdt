  <title>Eclipse Device Debug - Debugger Services Framework - View Model</title>
</head>
<body>
Provides a set of&nbsp; utilities and interfaces for defining the
conent and layout of views based on Debugger Services Framework (DSF).<br>
<br>
<h2>Package Specification</h2>
<p>The DSF data model is designed in a way to make it easy to achieve
modularity in the services that collectively make-up its
contents.&nbsp; This design goal makes it difficult to display the data
in a view, because its layout of the data needs to depend on the type
of view.&nbsp; This package is used to make it simpler to take the
contents of a data model and display them in various debug views, using
the platform debug flexible-hierarchy asynchronous debug
views.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
</p>
<h3>Development Plans</h3>
This package is also a work in progress and it is missing a major
feature.&nbsp;
This feature is to be able to create a complete view layout using a
simple data specification (XML or other format).&nbsp; Still further, a
feature to build on this, should allow users to modify the view layout
using GUI tools and to apply the modified layout at runtime.<br>

/**
 * The base class for data model objects.
 * <p>
 * DSF services need to return objects to clients which can be used as
 * handles to track data stored in the service.  Clients such as lazy-loading
 * tree and table views retrieve a list of handles, then as needed, they
 * retrieve the children and label information for these handles.  Because of
 * this pattern, services need to be able to return a set of handle objects,
 * then as needed clients can retrieve data corresponding to these handles.
 * The Data Model Context object is the interface that DSF services should use
 * to represent the handle objects that are to be referenced by view model.
 * <p>
 * <i>Note: DM contexts are meant to be immutable and thus accessible from
 * any thread instead of just the services dispatch thread. This is because
 * clients may need to call context objects' methods on non-dispatch thread,
 * especially equals and hashCode.</i>
 * <p>
 * <i>Note #2: DM Contexts should also avoid holding references to service
 * instances or other large chunks of data, because some of the clients may
 * hold onto these objects for longer time than the life of the service.
 * This may prevent the service from being garbage collected, possibly keeping
 * a lot of resources tied up.

  <title>Eclipse Device Debug - Debugger Services Framework - Data Model</title>
</head>
<body>
Provides a base API and utilities for expoding data model through DSF
services.<br>
<br>
<h2>Package Specification</h2>
Practically speaking, all state data held by the DSF services makes up
the "data mode" of the service session.&nbsp; However, to make it easy
to present this data in standard debug views, as well as customizable
views, it is useful to present the data using a consisten pattern and
with a set of published APIs and utilities.&nbsp; This package aims to
provide these APIs and utilities.<br>
<h3>Development Plans</h3>
This package is a work in progress and it is missing a major
feature.&nbsp; This feature is being able to automatically parametrize
the contents of the data model in order to generically traverse it, and
to write data-driven framework for populating views with model data.<br>

 * An extension to {@link ICBreakpoint} with model-specific breakpoint

 * mechanism to edit and store model-specific data in the original breakpoint
 * object.
 *
 * A breakpoint extension is defined by an extension of kind
 * <code>"org.eclipse.cdt.debug.core.BreakpointExtension"</code></li>.
 * The <code>ICBreakpoint</code> implementation instantiates breakpoint
 * extensions registered for its specific marker type when a client requests
 * extensions for a given debug model type.  Thus the extension classes and
 * plugins that declare them are not loaded unless requested by a client.

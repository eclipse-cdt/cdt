      "message": "\"Since Eclipse 3.6, implementations shall also make a best effort to consult UNIX umask in order to set the same attributes for other access groups. This setting of attributes for others may change the file system state even if an attribute appears to be set for the current user already.\"\n\nIt seems that the order we set the flags for owner/group/other might change the end result, depending on umask.

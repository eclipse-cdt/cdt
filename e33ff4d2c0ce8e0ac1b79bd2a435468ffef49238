      "message": "To work correctly, this code has to assume that a UNC path begins with either \u0027//\u0027 or \u0027\\\\\u0027. It was already doing this before. The new code just makes the assumptions explicit and generates a warning if the assumptions are wrong, which makes the code less dangerous.\n\nUNCPathConverter.isUNC defines what is and is not a valid UNC path. I agree it would be best if this code guaranteed the needed conditions, but I don\u0027t know if these conditions must always be true. If I were to change the definition instead, and the definition is later expanded, the code would silently fail.",

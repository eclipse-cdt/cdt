It would be nice to resolve this TODO.\n\nEither way I hope that getFileForLocation will do the correct thing. If there are general issues, now is a good time to get them resolved in platform",

But cmake4eclipse never received any issues. Or nobody uses that scenario. Or THE DOCKERIZER did a REALLY cool job.\n\n@Alexander Maybe my cmake project generator could be useful to you to set up testing on windows. It generates a cmake project (CMakeLists.txt + C-sourcefiles, but no eclipse project).",

AFAIK, NTFS is fine with forward slashes. So the build will succeed.\nThe problem lies in\n4) windows host, building in linux container. Path names might be sth. like ´/h/develop/ccdl/.../a.c´. Would a Path.fromOSString() in Eclipse hosted on windows return a proper IFile resource? That is what I like to be tested.\n\nI would be fine to mark this as *potential problem* with a TODO in the source and a reference in the online docs that tells end-users bitten by the problem being *actual* to sponsor to help resolve the problem (giving man-power, hardware, windows licenses).\n[I am doing this in my spare time]",

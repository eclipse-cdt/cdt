      "message": "We haven\u0027t been paying attention to whitespace \u0027issues\u0027 before.  I think that since we all code in Eclipse, those whitespaces don\u0027t bother anyone.  However, I know other eclipse projects are very strict about that.  I personally hope we don\u0027t go there, but this could always be discussed between the different committers.\n\nIn this case, I believe I just pressed \u003center\u003e in eclipse, and it added those whitespaces automatically.\n\nPersonally, I\u0027ve turned off the notification about whitespace in Gerrit.",

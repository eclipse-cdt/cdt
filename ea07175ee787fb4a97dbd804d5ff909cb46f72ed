      "message": "The documentation for IASTNode.getFileLocation() says:\n\n     * The method may return {@code null} in case the node does not have a file-location. This\n     * is for instance the case for built-in macro names or empty names for anonymous type\n     * declarations.\n\nIt\u0027s not entirely clear to me why such a name would end up here, but a user submitted an error report about an NPE here, so adding a check seems appropriate.",

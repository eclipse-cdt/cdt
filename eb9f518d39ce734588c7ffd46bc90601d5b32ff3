      "message": "Well, not a particular use-case other than those that are already sub-classing one of the \"default\" implementations. My hope is that in some future release of CDT, there will be only one interface that contains everything.\n\nNow that I think about it, maybe it\u0027s better to define this method in the ICustomBuildOptionEditor interface and have a default implementation that returns false. Then it\u0027s not intrusive and less clutter.\nIs that a better solution or is it better to have 2 distinct interfaces that hopefully will be merged in some API breaking release in the future?",

Because of how widespread the class is used I would err on the side of a new interface still and then merge them in some future release.\n\nAdding default methods technically breaks API, but historically CDT has allowed it for places where it is very unlikely to have a name clash. While it is still unlikely, it is not /very/ unlikely in this case :-)\n\nSo, I say this is resolved and we\u0027ll go as is.",

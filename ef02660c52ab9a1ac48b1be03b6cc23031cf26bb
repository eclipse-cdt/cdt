      "message": "Hmm - it seems like some automatic settings in Eclipse IDE are not quite right that you are getting this whitespace at end of the line inserted.\n\nThe Java formatter does insert this whitespace - but the \"Remove trailing white spaces on all lines\" save action should then remove it. I can see that in this case the \"Remove trailing white spaces on all lines\" does not appear to be running after the formatter consistently and I can reproduce it introducing these trailing whitespace lines.\n\nI am sure you have a solution in mind - for example you could just stage the relevant lines. Adding the missing * on the line also fixes the problem.",

      "message": "(This is the only change that I reject the gerrit on.)\n\nThere is a better way of doing this - you don\u0027t need to keep track of the tickRemaining yourself.\n\nThe original amounts look correct to me, but sometimes don\u0027t use the whole 100%. The original code relied on the .done() to \"finish\" the monitor. In the SubMonitor case the done is implicit, so you don\u0027t need to worry about not using all 100% of the monitor, however you can call done if you want.\n\nThe reason I don\u0027t like this code is that it isn\u0027t easy to just tell if the code is correct. If someone adds an additional step they can cause the tickRemaining to fall to or below 0. It is essentially an error and if you have tracing on (https://i.imgur.com/awyHvCa.png) it will log the error.\n\nTherefore I recommend using the existing splits amounts, or even change the initial convert to 4 and splitting by 1 each time.\n\nIf you want the monitor to complete within this method you can call subMonitor.done() - from the docs \"[callee] Will not promise to call done() on the monitor, although it is allowed to do so.\"",

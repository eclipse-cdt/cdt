      "message": "Yes, it would need some cleanup.\nI\u0027m not quite sure how to properly handle the cleanup/escaping as it would introduce a risk of duplicating make targets and those would not work. \nMaybe the best solution would be to simply remove anything except [A-Za-z0-9_.-] from the string and then append the hash (sha1?) of the full moduleOutputPath? That should be pretty unique...\nThe other possibility is to simply have a counter, but then every subdir.mk needs to be generate if there is one that needs an update and I\u0027m currently not sure that\u0027s the case.\n\nLet me know what you think.",

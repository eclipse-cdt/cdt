Indeed the c2 link has lots of discussion on this point. \n\nTraditionally the way Eclipse has solved this problem (i.e. the \"missing\" get URI method on IDocument) is to use adaptables - but that may just be too heavyweight for what is a simple method call. However LSP4E having an ILSPDocument that IDocument adapts to that provides all the (relevant) stuff in LSPEclipseUtils would be good.\n\nAnyway, none of this affects my vote on this change, more food for thought.\n\nA general discussion on coding styles should indeed happen on cdt-dev - however I would be keen to wherever possible not reinvent the wheel and follow Eclipse Platform lead.",

      "message": "\u003e Would it be more clear if I rename it to \"ResolveDocumentUri\"?\n\nSure - but of course I have spent years reading code with -er etc, so not calling it \"DocumentUriResolver\" (or as Marc-Andre suggested \"DocumentUriExtractor\") is a cultural change that may be hard. If you want to make that cultural change, I am ok with it, the challenge is bringing everyone along with you.\n\n\u003e BTW, I would not consider`LSPEclipseUtils` as a good example - it is a collection of procedures for everything with a lot of dependencies and assumptions, and it has good potential to grow to a monster. I plan to provide more focused alternatives for it and then suggest it for LSP4E.\n\nLSPEclipseUtils is not an example - it has lots of useful functions that in a OO world should be methods on the document object. So I would add an adapter from IDocument -\u003e ILSPDocument (and back) and the ILSPDocument interface would have methods like getFile, getURI, getDocumentContentTypes, toPosition, etc. (Another related cultural change is the dropping of \"get\", and a third is not returning null - so lots of cultural style changes outside the scope).",

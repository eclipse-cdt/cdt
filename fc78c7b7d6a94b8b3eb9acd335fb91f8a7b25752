      "message": "This introduces a direct dependency to dsf.gdb, which would be nice to avoid.  I believe the standalone debugger could work with\nanother debugger integration than dsf-gdb.  We could move this the other LaunchUtils which is in the launch plugin, but I\u0027m thinking\nthat this functionality is not related to the launch; it could go into debug.core; I\u0027m even wondering if we could implement\na full binary parser using GDB as an external tool instead of doing it in CDT.  Until we have a clear idea of where this should\ngo, I recommend putting in somewhere internal where it is not API.  You can even put it in this file as an option.",

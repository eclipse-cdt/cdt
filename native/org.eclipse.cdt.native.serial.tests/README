These serial tests require setting up paired serial ports, that are connected
via null-modem cable. These could also be virtual serial ports performing the
same function.

Most tests start a simulator to generate data on one port before the test
begins, and then the automated tests listen on the paired port to verify data
received.

To create the paired virtual ports for initial implementation and testing,
following utilities were used:

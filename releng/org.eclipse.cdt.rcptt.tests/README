Preparations: 
a) Make sure to use maven 3.1 or even better 3.3
b) Download the latest 2.1 RCPTT NIGHTLY  build
	http://www.eclipse.org/rcptt/download/


Building and Running with maven:
1) Do a full maven build to create the Application Under Test (AUT) from a generated CDT RCP

	> mvn clean install -DskipTests -Dmvn.test.skip=true

2) Locate the application for your platform under:

	<cdt-git-root>/dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb.product/target/products/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb.product

e.g. for linux 64 bits:
	<cdt-git-root>/dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb.product/target/products/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb.product/linux/gtk/x86_64/cdt-rcp

3) Go to the cdt rcptt test bundle directory, and trigger the tests via maven 
	> cd <cdt-git-root>/releng/org.eclipse.cdt.rcptt.tests  
	
4) Trigger the test execution via maven
	> mvn clean install



Running the test cases manually within the RCPTT application:
* After the installation of RCPTT mentioned under preparations.

1) Import the rcptt test bundle project
	File -> Import -> General -> Existing Projects into Workspace -> 
		<cdt-git-root>/releng/org.eclipse.cdt.rcptt.tests

2) Open the test case 
	tests -> helloWorld

3) Click Replay and add the CDT RCP as an Application under test
    * Note that this CDT RCP was generated with maven under the Buliding and Running with maven steps above

    the browse location depends on your platform, this example shows the path for linux 64 bits
	<cdt-git-root>/dsf-gdb/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb.product/target/products/org.eclipse.cdt.dsf.gdb.product/linux/gtk/x86_64/cdt-rcp

4) When finished successfully the execution view will show the test case with a green check mark decorator and the execution time.

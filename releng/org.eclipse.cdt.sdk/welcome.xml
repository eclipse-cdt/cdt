	<intro>The CDT project provides a set of plugins that implement a C/C++ IDE.
It adds a C/C++ Perspective to the Eclipse Workbench that supports C/C++ development
with a number of views, wizards, a powerful editor, and a debugger. The CDT is designed
to provide an extensible architecture, that will provide support for integration of tools
provided by Independent Software Vendors. 

This page will help familiarize you with the Eclipse C/C++ development tooling.

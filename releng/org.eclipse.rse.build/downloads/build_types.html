        that have been declared major releases by the development team - for example 
        &quot;R1.0&quot;. Releases are the right builds for people who want to 
        be on a stable, tested release, and don't need the latest greatest features 
        and improvements. Release builds always have an &quot;R&quot; at the beginning 
        of the name i.e. R1.0, R2.0 etc. Non-release builds are named according to the 
        date of the build - for example 20060427 is the build from April 27, 2006.</font><br>

      <font size="-1" face="arial,helvetica,geneva"> Stable builds are integration 
      builds that have been found to be stable enough for most people to use. 
      They are promoted from integration build to stable build by the architecture 
      team after they have been used for a few days and deemed reasonably stable. 
      The latest stable build is the right build for people who want to stay up 
      to date with what is going on in the latest development stream, and don't 
      mind putting up with a few problems n in order to get the latest greatest 
      features and bug fixes. The latest stable build is the one the development 
      team likes people to be using, because of the valuable and timely feedback.

        <font size="-1" face="arial,helvetica,geneva"> Periodically, component 
        teams version off their work in what they believe is a stable, consistent 
        state, and they update the build configuration to indicate that the next 
        integration build should take this version of the component. Integration 
        builds are built from these stable component versions that have been specified 
        by each component team as the best version available. Integration builds 
        may be promoted to stable builds after a few days of testing. Integration 
        builds are built whenever new stable component versions are released into 
        the build.</font></p>

      CVS repository. They are completely untested and will almost always have 
      major problems. Many will not work at all. These drops are normally only 
      useful to developers actually working on the Eclipse Project.</font></td>

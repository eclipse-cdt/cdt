<h1>RSE Logger API</h1>
<p>To use the RSE logging framework, you must first decide if you want your own log file,
or want to use the common RSE log file.
</p>

<h2>Using Your Own Log File</h2>
<p>
The log file support is encapsulated in a separate plugin, <b><samp>org.eclipse.rse.logging</samp></b>, which
defines the primary <samp><A href="../../../reference/api/org/eclipse/rse/logging/Logger.html">org.eclipse.rse.logging.Logger</a></samp> class that manages the log file.
This log file support offers the ability to log the following types of log messages:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Error</b>. These are serious errors detected by your programming logic.
<li><b>Warning</b>. These are warning situations detected by your programming logic.
<li><b>Information</b>. These are informational messages you want to capture to help with problem determination.
<li><b>Debug</b>. These are trace statements typically only enabled in development drivers.
</ul>

<p>To define your own logging file, in your plugin class:</p>
<ol>
<li>Define a static variable to hold the Logger instance, as in:<br>
<code>protected static Logger log = null;</code>
<li>Instantiate the Logger object, in your plugin class constructor, as in:<br>
				<code>if (log == null) log = LoggerFactory.getLogger(this);</code>
<li>For convenience, offer fastpaths to the logXXX methods in your Logger instance:
<pre>
    public static void <b>logInfo</b>(String message)
    {
    	log.logInfo(message);
    }
    public static void <b>logWarning</b>(String message)
    {
    	log.logWarning(message);
    }
    public static void <b>logError</b>(String message)
    {
    	log.logError(message, null);
    }
    public static void <b>logError</b>(String message, Throwable exception)
    {
    	log.logError(message, exception);
    }
    public static void <b>logDebugMessage</b>(String prefix, String message)
    {		
     log.logDebugMessage(prefix, message);
    }		
</pre>
<li>In the <samp>shutdown</samp> method of your plugin class, close the log file:
<code>LoggerFactory.freeLogger(this); </code>
</ol>
<p>Typically your code will write a healthy number of messages to the log file, to help you determine
what went wrong in an error situation in production. However, since this can result in a large number of
messages in the log file, it is recommended that you offer the user's a preference page in which they
can specify the types of messages to record in the log file, which should default to error messages only.
In the event of a problem, they can then turn on a more verbose logging option and re-produce the problem,
sending the log file to you for additional information. For example, for the Remote System Explorer, this
preference page is supplied:</p>
<P><IMG border="0" src="logPreferences.gif"></P>

<h2>Using The Common RSE Log File</h2>
<p>To log your messages to the common RSE log file in <samp>.metadata\plugins\org.eclipse.rse.ui</samp>,
either base your plugin class on the <samp>org.eclipse.rse.core.SystemBasePlugin</samp> class and use
the inherited logging methods, or instead of instantiating your own <samp>Logging</samp> object, re-use the
RSE-supplied logging object by calling <samp>getDefault().getLog()</samp> in the <samp>org.eclipse.rse.ui.RSEUIPlugin</samp>
class.

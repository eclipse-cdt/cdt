<h1>Remote System Explorer Overview</h1>

<p>
The perspective for managing connections is the <A href="rse.gif"><B>Remote
System Explorer</B></A> (<b>RSE</b>), and the primary tree-view within it is the 
<A href="view_RS.gif"><B>Remote Systems</B></A> view. We assume you are already familiar with the RSE perspective, or will familiarize
yourself with it, and you are now interested in learning how to extend it. We also assume that you 
already understand the concepts of plug-ins, extension points, and the workbench UI. You do not need 
to be familiar with workspace resources, as the RSE does not use these to realize the artifacts it 
shows to the user.
</p>
<p>A user can extend the Remote System Explorer by adding their own <A
	href="Artifacts.html#filters">filters</A>, <A
	href="Artifacts.html#useractions">user actions</A>, and <A
	href="Artifacts.html#compilecmds">compile commands</A>.
They may also customize the RSE by setting <A
	href="Artifacts.html#preferences">preferences</A>.</p>
<p>
As a programmer, you can extend the Remote System Explorer by using <A
	href="plugin.html">RSE-unique extension points</A> to 
add property pages to remote objects, add actions to the pop-up menus for remote objects, and 
even create your own subsystems that appear when a connection is expanded. The full Eclipse application 
programming interface (API) set is
at your disposal for these, as well as the API set supplied by the Remote System Explorer. Furthermore,
you can use existing Eclipse extension points to author menu items, tool bar actions, pop-up menu actions,
and more for non-remote objects in the Remote System Explorer. 
</p>
<p>
This guide explains all underlying 
artifacts and model of the Remote System Explorer, the RSE extension points, and highlights the 
important APIs available for your use.

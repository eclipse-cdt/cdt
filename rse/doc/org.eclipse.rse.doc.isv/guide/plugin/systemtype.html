<h1>Plugging In System Types</h1>
<p>The <samp><A href="../../doc/org_eclipse_rse_ui_systemtype.html">org.eclipse.rse.ui.systemType</a></samp> extension point is defined in the
plugin <samp>org.eclipse.rse.ui</samp>. It enables new system types to be
defined in the Remote System Explorer's <A href="NewConnection.gif">New
Connection wizard</A>, such that users can define connections to systems of that type. For example,
you might define a new system type of "Solaris" or "RedHat" or some other specific type
of operating system. The reason to define a system type is to enable tools to be created,
via the <A href="subsystem.html">subsystem extension point</A>, that are scoped so as to
only appear for connections to systems of that type.
</p>
<p>
Defining a new system type is easy. You merely need to supply the name of the system
type, and two icons - one icon for connections to that systems of that type, and another
adorned icon that is used when there is a live connection to that particular system.
</p>
<p>
When you create a new connection, the Remote System Explorer framework will consult
each registered <A href="subsystem.html">subsystem extension point</A> to see if it supports
that connection's system type, and if so the extension point's subsystem factory class
will be used to create a new subsystem within the new connection. Thus, when the user
expands a connection in the Remote Systems view, only subsystems supported for that
connection's system type are available.

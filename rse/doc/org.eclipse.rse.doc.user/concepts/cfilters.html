and filter pool references</h1>
<div>
<p>The Remote System Explorer is a set of local client tools you use to
organize
how you want to work with the resources such as folders and files on
your
remote server. The following graphic serves as an introduction to
some of the main components of the Remote System Explorer:<br/>
<img src="../images/ModelRSE.gif" alt=""/><br/>
</p>
<div class="p">In the Remote System Explorer perspective, you query
your server
to list and perform actions upon remote resources such as folders and
files. You perform
these tasks on these remote resources by using <i>filters</i> that
show these resources at your workstation.<br/>
</div>
<p>The Remote System Explorer perspective is designed to allow you to
manipulate the resources directly on the remote system.&nbsp; The
actions that are available depend on the type of system you are
connecting to and the way the resource is recognized.&nbsp; For
example, your selections can define
a filter string to find all files that match *.c in a particular
directory. </p>
<div class="p">When you access the list by expanding the filter, you
can see all the files that match that filter and you can perform
actions (such as editing, compiling, running, and debugging) against
these files.
<div class="note"><span class="notetitle">Note: </span>You can drag
and drop filters from one subsystem or filter
pool to another. However, if you drag a filter into another filter, the
filter strings from the source filter are added to the ones already in
the target
filter.</div>
</div>
<p id="cfilters__poolsdesc"><a name="cfilters__poolsdesc"><!-- --></a>If
you have been using the Remote System Explorer for some
time, your workspace might contain too many filters to navigate easily.
Or,
you might just want to keep groups of filters separate if, for example,
you
need to represent two distinct environments in the Remote System
Explorer,
regardless of how many filters you have. In either case, you can group
filters
into <i>filter pools</i>. </p>
<p>For example, one filter pool could contain filters for an accounts
receivable
program while another contains filters for a payroll program. Or, if
you
have two different environments on your server: a production
environment and a test environment, you can define a distinct
environment and set of filters for each. </p>
<p id="cfilters__poolsdesc2"><a name="cfilters__poolsdesc2"><!-- --></a>Without
filter pools, all of your filters appear together
in all connections. When you create filter pools, however, any filter
you
create within that filter pool is distinct to that connection, and will
not
appear in any other connections. (See the related links for more
information
about filter pools.)</p>
<p id="cfilters__filterstrings"><a name="cfilters__filterstrings"><!-- --></a>You
can share filter pools among many connections through
the use of a <i>filter pool reference</i>. A filter pool reference is
a mechanism
that displays a filter pool from one connection in any other
connection, so
that when you make a change to the original filter pool, your change is
reflected
your filter pool reference.</p>
<p>All connections, filters, filter pools, and so on, belong to a
Remote System Explorer <i>profile</i>, that you define during your
first connection
to a server. You might wonder what happens to your filters or filter
pools if you delete a connection, especially if you have filters shared
among
two or more connections. Rest assured that the filters are not deleted,
since
filters actually belong to profiles, and not connections.<br/>
</p>
<p>Keep in mind that if you need to have an entirely new configuration
of filter pools, filters and connection in the Remote System Explorer,
you can always create a new profile. See
the related links for more information.</p>

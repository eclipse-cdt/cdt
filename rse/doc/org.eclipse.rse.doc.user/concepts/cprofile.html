<h1 class="topictitle1">Remote System Explorer Profiles</h1>
<div>
<p>When you define your first connection to your remote server, you
will also define
your first profile. All Remote System Explorer resources such as
connections,
filters, and filter pools are owned by a profile. Profiles help you
manage these resources when you have a lot of connections. The Remote
System Explorer creates
a unique profile per team member (that person's <span
 style="font-style: italic;">private profile</span>), plus a common
profile called <i>Team</i>.
You can also create your own profiles. </p>
<div class="p">Profiles contain:
<ul>
  <li>Connections -- including subsystem properties. User IDs and
passwords are not shared.</li>
  <li>Filters, filter pools, and filters pool references</li>
  <li>User-defined actions</li>
  <li>Compile commands</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>Profiles can be active, or inactive. By default, only your private
profile
and the Team profile are active. The Remote System Explorer displays
all connections
from all active profiles and, within a connection, allows filter pools
to
be referenced from any active profile. Further, the user actions and
compile
commands shown in the right-click menu for a remote resource are from
all
active profiles.</p>
<p>Your first profile will be for your local workstation. When you
complete
the steps for your first connection, you can decide whether to use your
personal
profile or the Team profile so that you can share resources and
information
with other people.</p>
<div class="p">Placing all connection and filter data in a profile
shared by the team
assists in team support, since all connections, filter pools, and team
profiles
can be shared among team members. You can use the Team view to control
which
profiles display in your workspace by making the profiles active.
<div class="note"><span class="notetitle">Note: </span>Making
a profile active or inactive does not affect your teammates. For
example,
you can choose not to display one of your own profiles in your
workspace,
but a teammate can make that profile active in his or her workspace.
You will
see the profiles you or your teammates have made inactive in the Team
view when you perform a synchronization with the repository in which
the profiles are stored.&nbsp; See topics in the help contents and
links
below about team support for more information on profiles and shared
data.</div>
</div>
<p>To reduce collisions when you synchronize the user IDs and the
ordering of
resources in a profile are stored locally on your workstation. To
participate
in team support, you need to synchronize with, and upload your profiles
to a central repository. Use the <a href="../tasks/tteamsup.html">Team
view</a> to
share source and profile information with other team members, and to
synchronize
that information with the repository. Everything except your user ID
will
then be stored on the server, and any developer can obtain profile
resources
from the central server. </p>

<h1 class="topictitle1">Compiling Programs</h1>
<div>
<p>You can run a compile command on a server from the Remote System
Explorer perspective.&nbsp; When you compile, the workbench determines
the source type of the file, and then runs
the last used compile command for that type. However, you can always
change
this behavior through Remote Systems preferences (see the related
links).</p>
<p>You can also compile multiple resources listed in a filter by
holding down the CTRL key and clicking on all the members
you want to compile, right-click to access the compile menu, and then
select the compile command you wish to run. The workbench determines
what order to compile these resources according to the preferences you
specify for that workspace.</p>
<div class="p">Note that multiple file compilation is disabled if:
<ul>
  <li>One or more of the selected source types are not compatible.</li>
  <li>The selected resources are not from the same connection.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>A compile command is always associated with a particular source
type. It consists of an identifier and a command string that will be
run on the
server.&nbsp; Each profile in the Remote System Explorer has a set of
source member types,
and each source type has a set of compile commands associated with
them. You
can add source types to a profile and add compile commands to a source
type.</p>
<p>IBM supplies a number
of default compile commands for common file types and you can also add
your own.&nbsp; Since compile commands are owned by a profile they can
be shared using team support.</p>

<div>
<p>At a minimum the Remote System Explorer provides access to&nbsp;
Linux,
UNIX, and Windows systems.&nbsp; These are called "universal" systems
since their file and command systems are quite similar.&nbsp; You can
export,
import, explore remote files, and run remote
commands on all of these system types.
You can also drag/drop and copy/paste between
two systems of the same or different type.
For example, you can drag and drop a file
from your Windows host to your Linux host,
from one Linux host to another, or from one
file in your Linux host to another file in
the same host.</p>
<p>The Remote System Explorer can also provide access to other types of
systems if the support is installed in the workbench.&nbsp; Examples of
such systems might be IBM iSeries or zSeries server systems.<br/>

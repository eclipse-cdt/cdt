<h1 class="topictitle1">First Steps with the Remote System Explorer</h1>

Even without an actual connection to a remote system, you can start experimenting 
with the Remote System Explorer UI on the local host, which is shown by default
under the <i>Local</i> node:
<ul>
  <li>Browse the Filesystem, choose <i>contextmenu &gt; show in Table</i>, and 
     observe the Properties view.</li>
  <li>Create a new <a href="../concepts/cfilters.html">Filter</a> to show 
     specific resources in the file system only.</li>
  <li>Launch an <a href="../concepts/crunremcmds.html">RSE Shell</a>
     (Shells node &gt; Launch)
      <ul><li>In the Shell, perform commands such as ls, dir, ps, gcc, make and see 
         the output interpreted</li>
          <li>Use Ctrl+Space Content Assist on the shell command entry field</li>
      </ul></li>
</ul>
For operations on an actual remote system, you can either
<ul>
  <li>use the "<b>SSH Only</b>" system type (<i>New > Other > Remote System Explorer > Connection</i>), or</li>
  <li>start a <a href="../tasks/tbeginlinux.html">dstore server daemon</a>
      on the remote system and use any of the other connection types.</li>
</ul>
<p>RSE is a framework that supports plugging in many different communication protocols.
By default, the dstore, FTP and ssh protocol plug-ins are provided, with dstore being 
the richest in features.<br />
DStore requires a server to run on the remote system. There are several methods to 
get a server launched for a particular user, the most easy one to set up is the 
daemon method.</p>

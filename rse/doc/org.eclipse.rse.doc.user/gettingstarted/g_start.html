<h1 class="topictitle1">Getting Started with the Remote System Explorer</h1>

<p>The Remote System Explorer (RSE) is a perspective and toolkit in Eclipse
Workbench, that allows you to connect and work with a variety of remote 
systems. With the predefined plug-ins, You can look at remote file systems, 
transfer files between hosts, do remote search, execute commands and work
with processes.</p>
<p>Additional capabilities may be added by Software Vendors by providing new
<i>System Types</i>, <i>Services</i> and <i>Subsystem implementations</i> 
for specific remote access protocols or resource kinds respectively. The framework
helps by providing lots of predefined re-usable components, like persistence 
mechanisms, filtering and team sharing.</p>

<h1 class="topictitle1">Connecting to a remote Linux or UNIX server</h1>
<p>The following documentation explains how to install the Linux or UNIX server
code, start the server daemon, and make a connection to a remote Linux
or UNIX server.</p>
<div>
<div class="p">
<p><b>Prerequisites</b></p>
<p>To use the Remote System Explorer communications server daemon you need
to install Perl. Using the daemon helps eliminate some of the manual steps
when you connect to the server.</p>
<p><b>Installing the server code</b></p>
<div class="p">
<ol>
<li>
Find the package that contains the server.
The server code is usually packaged with the containing product and you should refer to that 
product's documentation for finding and installing the server package.
The server is also available, however, on the Eclipse DSDP Target Management download site as the package
rseserver-&lt;version&gt;-&lt;os&gt;.tar. For example, rseserver-1.0-linux.tar contains the release 1.0 server
for Linux. There are servers for Linux, AIX, a generic Unix version that can be tailored to your particular flavor
of Unix, and an experimental Mac OS X version.</li> 
<li>Ensure that Perl is installed.</li>
<li>Ensure that a Java Runtime Environment (JRE) version 1.4 or higher is installed.</li>
<li>Create a directory where you want to install the server code. The remainder
of these instructions will assume the directory /opt/rseserver (suitable for
team sharing), but you are free to use any directory.</li>
<li>Upload the server package to this directory. You can use FTP.</li>
<li>Switch to the /opt/rseserver directory by typing:
<pre>cd /opt/rseserver</pre>
</li>
<li>Run the following command in the /opt/rseserver directory to extract the
server code from the package appropriate to your operating system. For linux this command is:
<pre>tar -xf rseserver-1.0-linux.tar</pre>
</li>
<li>Still in the /opt/rseserver directory, run the following configuration
commands:
<pre>
chmod 755 server.pl
chmod 755 daemon.pl
chmod 755 auth.pl
</pre>
</li>
</ol>
</div>

<p><b>Starting the server</b></p>
<div class="p">You can start the RSE communications
server with the server daemon, or manually. Before starting the server, make
sure the Java command is in your path, you can do this by running the following
command:<pre>java -version</pre>
</div>
<div class="p">You should see something
similar to the following:<pre>java version "1.4.1"
Java(TM) 2 Runtime Environment, Standard Edition (build 1.4.1)
Classic VM (build 1.4.1, J2RE 1.4.1 IBM build cxppc321411-20040301 (JIT enabled: jitc))</pre>
</div>
<div class="p">If
you receive a "command not found" error, then try creating a symbolic link
to the java command in /usr/bin by running the following command:<pre>ln -s  /opt/IBMJava2-141/jre/bin/java /usr/bin/java</pre>
</div>
<div class="p"><b>To start the server with the server daemon</b>
<ol>
<li>Ensure that you are running using the root user ID. (If the daemon is
not run under root, it will be unable to authenticate connecting users.) Run
the following commands:<pre>su -l root
cd /opt/rseserver
perl ./daemon.pl</pre>
</li>
</ol>
Note that the server daemon runs on port 4035. You can also start the
daemon.unix in the same way.<br></br>
<p><b>To start the server manually</b></p>
<div class="p">Run
the following commands:<pre>cd /opt/rseserver
perl ./server.pl [port]</pre>
These commands run the server.pl
script located in the /opt/rseserver directory. If this does not work, try
changing the permission attributes on server.pl (for example, enter <samp class="codeph">chmod
755 server.pl</samp>. The port parameter to the server.pl script is
optional. If you do not specify a port, then the server will pick the first
one available and print the port number to standard out. By default, it is
usually 4033. If you would like to use a different port, you will then have
to enter this port number in port property for the Files subsystem for your
connection in the Remote System Explorer (see <span class="uicontrol">Connecting to the
Remote Server</span>, below). Otherwise, you do not need to change this
property.</div>
<p><b>Running the daemon at startup</b></p>
<div class="p">You might instead want
to configure the daemon to run at start up for Linux. To do so, you need to
append a call to the daemon to your startup script.  Add the following lines
to the bottom of the /etc/rc.d/rc.local file:<pre>cd /opt/rseserver
perl ./daemon.pl &amp;</pre>
</div>
</div>
</div><br></br>
<p><b>Connecting to the Remote Server</b></p>
<div class="p">To make a connection
to your remote server:</div>
<ol>
  <li><span>Switch to the Remote System Explorer perspective. From the workbench
menu, click <span class="menucascade"><span class="uicontrol">Window </span> &gt; <span class="uicontrol">Open Perspective </span> &gt; <span class="uicontrol">Remote System Explorer</span></span>.</span></li>
  <li><span>In the Remote Systems view, <b>New Connection</b> is automatically
expanded to show the various remote systems you can connect to through the
Remote System Explorer. Expand <b>Linux</b> or <b>Unix</b> to
invoke the new connection dialog box and configure a connection.</span></li>
  <li><span>Enter a name for your first profile and click <b>Next</b>. (This
step only occurs if you have never defined a connection before.)</span></li>
  <li><span>Enter a connection name. This name displays in your tree view and
must be unique to the profile.</span></li>
  <li><span>Enter the name or TCP/IP address of your Linux server in the <b>Host
name</b> field, for example, LINUX_A.</span></li>
  <li><span>(Optional) Enter a <b>Description</b>. The description appears
in the Properties view after the connection is created.</span></li>
  <li><span>Click <b>Finish</b> to define your system. </span></li>
</ol>
<div class="skipspace">
<div class="attention"><span class="attentiontitle">Attention: </span>To check your port number, right-click your
connection or subsystem from the Remote Systems view and select <b>Properties</b>.
Click <b>Subsystem</b> to view the relevant information. If your port is "0,"
then your Remote System Explorer communications server will pick any free
port on the server. If you specified a port number when starting the server,
you need to enter it here, for example, to work with a firewall.</div>

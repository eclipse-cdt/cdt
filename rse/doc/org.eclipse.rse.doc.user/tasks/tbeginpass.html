<h1>Saving passwords for remote systems</h1>
<p>When you use the Remote System Explorer,
you can save passwords for remote systems
on your local PC. The stored passwords are
then retrieved whenever a password is required
to connect. When you save your password for
a particular remote system, you will not
be prompted to sign on when you try to connect
to that system. </p>
<p>When you first try to connect to a remote
system, you will be prompted with the following
dialog:</p>

<p>To save this password on your local PC:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Enter your user ID</li>
  <li>Enter your password</li>
  <li>Select <b>Save user ID</b></li>
  <li>Select <b>Save password</b></li>
</ol>
<p>The next time that you connect to the remote
system, you will not be prompted to sign
on again.</p>
<p><b>Note</b>: If you still want to be prompted for your
user ID and password, right-click on the
subsystem and select <b>Connect</b>. </p>
<h2>Adding, changing, and removing stored passwords</h2>
<p>You can use the password information page
to add, change, and remove stored passwords
for remote systems:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Select <b>Window</b> -&gt; <b>Preferences</b></li>
  <li>Expand <b>Remote Systems</b></li>
  <li>Select <b>Passwords</b></li>
</ol>
<p>Use the Add, Change, and Remove buttons to
manage your password information for remote
systems. </p>

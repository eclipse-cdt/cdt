<h1 class="topictitle1">Configuring filter pool references</h1>
<div>
<div class="p">
<p>You can share filter pools among many connections through
the use of a <i>filter pool reference</i>. A filter pool reference is a mechanism
that displays a filter pool from one connection in any other connection, so
that when you make a change to the original filter pool, your change is reflected
your filter pool reference.</p>
<div class="p">Before
you create a filter pool reference, ensure that you have already completed
the following (see related tasks for more information):
<ul>
<li>You have defined more than one connection to the same server</li>
<li>You have defined more than one filter pool</li>
<li>You have enabled <b>Show Filter Pools</b> from the Remote Systems view toolbar</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>To use filter pools references:</p>
<ol>
<li><span>In the Remote Systems view, expand the connection where you want
to display a filter pool that exists in another connection.</span></li>
<li><span>Right-click on a file subsystem and select <b>New &gt; Filter Pool
Reference &gt; <i>your profile</i> &gt; <i>name of pool</i></b>.</span></li>
<li><span>Look under that subsystem again and you will see the filter
pool reference.</span></li>
</ol>
<div class="p">To delete a filter pool reference, right-click it and select <b>Remove
reference</b>. You can also move your filter pools up and down with the
right-click menu.

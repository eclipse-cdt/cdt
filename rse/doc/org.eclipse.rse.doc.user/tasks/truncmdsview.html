<h1 class="topictitle1">Running and viewing commands and shells using the Remote Commands view </h1>
<div>
<div class="p">You can open a shell for your local and remote systems, from the
Remote System Explorer, <p><b>Opening the Remote Commands view and launching
a command shell</b></p>
<p>In the Remote System Explorer, switch to the Remote
Commands view by clicking <b>Window &gt; Show View &gt; Remote Commands</b> from
the menu bar. To open a new shell in the Remote Commands view, click the down
arrow in the view and select <b>Launch shell</b>. To launch a new shell for
another connection requires that an existing shell for that connection is
selected in the view. Otherwise, the shell must be launched from the Remote
Systems, Remote System Details, or the Remote Commands view.</p>
<p><b>Working with shells</b></p>
<p> When the Remote Commands view is open, you can work
with shells. When you work with a shell, you are working with a shell that
preserves its environment across commands. The environment for all commands
in the shell may change in response to your input.   For example, if you type
<pre>cd ..</pre>
you change the working directory for that shell.</p>
<p><b>Viewing output in an editor</b></p>
<p>You can double-click a line of output to open
it in an editor. For example, if you encounter an error while running a command,
you can double-click the error and the editor opens the source to the line
of code where the parser found a problem.</p>
<p><b>Closing shells</b></p>
<p>The <b>Cancel shell</b> toolbar item is enabled when the currently displayed shell or command
is active. Press <b>Cancel Shell</b>, to terminate that process.
If the shell is active, it cancels the shell before removing it from the view.</p>
<p><b>Content assist</b></p>
<p>The Remote Commands view supports content assist. You can press CTRL+space to complete file names
or environment variable names while you type commands.</p>

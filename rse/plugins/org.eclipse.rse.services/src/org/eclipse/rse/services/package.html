Application programming interface for the RSE Services Layer.
<h2>
Package Specification</h2>
<p>
The RSE Services layer provides interfaces and basic utility classes
for remote operations. There is no restriction whatsoever about the
kind of those operations, and actually there isn't even a need for
remote systems to be involved. The Services defined here provide
basic functionality for RSE to operate on.
</p><p>
The RSE Services layer is designed to have only minimal dependency into
Eclipse core APIs, such that Services can eventually be re-used in
environments outside Eclipse. This can be done today by providing a library
with mock objects for the few Eclipse interfaces that Services currently use:
<code>IAdaptable</code>, <code>IProgressMonitor</code>,
<code>IStatus</code>, <code>NLS</code>, <code>PlatformObject</code>
and few others related to the Eclipse Extension Registry, which are only
used in the Activator and can thus be replaced easily by a different 
mechanisms for providing extensions.

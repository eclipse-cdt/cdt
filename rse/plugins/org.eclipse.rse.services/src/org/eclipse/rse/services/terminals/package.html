Application programming interface for the RSE Base Shell and Terminal Services.
<h2>
Package Specification</h2>
<p>
The RSE Terminal Services packages provides interfaces and basic utility classes
for shell or terminal connections. The classes in this package are especially designed
to be extendable by means of the <b>Decorator</b> pattern as well as the <b>Adapter</b>
pattern:
<ul>
<li><code><a href="IBaseShell.html">IBaseShell</a></code>
    is the basic interface for communicating with a (potentially remote) process
    through a channel supporting Streams. The Interface is modeled after the
    <code><a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.2/docs/api/java/lang/Process.html">java.lang.Process</a></code>
    class, but provides some nice enhancements such as a timeout for the
    <code>waitFor()</code> method, as well as an <code>isActive()</code>
    method.</li>
<li><code><a href="ITerminalShell.html">ITerminalShell</a></code>
    extends IBaseShell, adding methods specific to the presentation of the data
    transferred from the (remote) process: it provides for getDefaultEncoding(),
    getPtyType(), isLocalEcho() as well as setTerminalSize() methods.</li>
<li><code><a href="AbstractTerminalShell.html">AbstractTerminalShell</a></code>
    is an abstract base class that implementers of ITerminalShell must extend.
    It provides default implementations of all methods where possible, and
    ensures that future evolving of the ITerminalShell interface
    can be done without breaking binary compatibility with extenders implementing it.</li>
<li><code><a href="BaseShellDecorator.html">BaseShellDecorator</a></code> and
    <code><a href="TerminalShellDecorator">TerminalShellDecorator</a></code> abstract base 
    classes should be used when clients want to add functionality by decorating
    an existing IBaseShell or ITerminalShell object they have. Again, extending 
    these not only saves the extender typing default delegation methods, but also
    ensures that they remain binary compatible in case the interfaces evolve.</li>
<li><code><a href="ITerminalService.html">ITerminalService</a></code>
    is the RSE Service Interface, and currently only 
    provides one factory method <code>launchTerminal()</code> for creating
    a new Terminal Connection.
    <code><a href="AbstractTerminalService">AbstractTerminalService</a></code> must be used as base
    class by extenders who wish to implement the ITerminalService, in order to ensure
    binary compatibility in case the interface evolves - even though
    the AbstractTerminalService is currently empty.</li>  
</ul>
The classes and interfaces in this package are designed to have only minimal 
dependency into Eclipse core APIs, such that Services can eventually be re-used in
environments outside Eclipse. Especially 
<code><a href="IBaseShell.html">IBaseShell</a></code> and
<code><a href="BaseShellDecorator.html">BaseShellDecorator</a></code> are usable in
any environment, provided that mock objects are provided for Eclipse
IAdaptable and PlatformObject.

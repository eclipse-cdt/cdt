Application programming interface for creating customized sftp file subsystems.
<h2>
Package Specification</h2>
The package provides support classes for creating customized sftp file
subsystems.
<p>The class <b>SftpFileSubSystemConfiguration</b> is the main factory
for creating an Sftp file subsystem. By deriving from it, extenders
can create their customized sftp file subsystem configuration which can 
then be registered against their system types. A custom
<b>SubSystemConfigurationAdapter</b> can be registered for UI-specific
customizations. Possible customizations include:
<ul>
<li>Changing the isCaseSensitive() method for system types that
  are not of UNIX style.</li>
<li>Registering pre-defined filters through a filter pool manager.</li>
<li>Wrapping the created FileServiceSubSystem or SftpFileService in a
  delegate for modifying operation of the Subsystem.</li>
</ul>

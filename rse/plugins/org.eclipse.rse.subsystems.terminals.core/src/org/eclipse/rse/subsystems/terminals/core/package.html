Application programming interface for creating customized terminal subsystems.
<h2>
Package Specification</h2>
This package provides classes and interfaces to support terminal
subsystems.
<p>The class <b>TerminalServiceSubSystemConfiguration</b> is the main factory
for creating a terminal subsystem. By deriving from it, extenders
can create their customized terminal subsystem configuration which can 
then be registered against their system types.
The class <b>TerminalServiceSubSystem</b> is a basic ITerminalServiceSubsystem implementation,
containing terminal instances as children.

# Make the org.eclipse.cdt.native feature dependency "optional" since it didn't
# exist in CDT 8.3 and we can also work on top of CDT 8.3.

# The real dependencies are all properly managed via p2.inf in the
# org.eclipse.tm.terminal.connector.process/META-INF/p2.inf file.
# The only benefit of requesting the feature here is that it allow pulling in
# additional fragments that we are not aware of in the bundle's p2.inf.

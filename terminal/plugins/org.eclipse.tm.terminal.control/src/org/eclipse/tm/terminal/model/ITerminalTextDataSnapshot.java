/**
 * This class maintains a snapshot of an instance of {@link ITerminalTextData}.
 * While the {@link ITerminalTextData} continues changing, the snapshot remains
 * unchanged until the next snapshot is taken by calling
 * {@link #updateSnapshot(boolean)}. This is important, because the
 * {@link ITerminalTextData} might get modified by another thread. Suppose you
 * would want to draw the content of the {@link ITerminalTextData} using the
 * following loop:
 *
 * <pre>
 * for (int line = 0; line &lt; term.getHeight(); line++)
 * 	for (int column = 0; column &lt; term.getWidth(); column++)
 * 		drawCharacter(column, line, term.getChar(column, line), term.getStyle(column, line));
 * </pre>
 *
 * This might fail because the background thread could change the dimensions of
 * the {@link ITerminalTextData} while you iterate the loop. One solution would
 * be to put a <code>synchronized(term){}</code> statement around the code. This
 * has two problems: 1. you would have to know about the internals of the
 * synchronisation of {@link ITerminalTextData}. 2. The other thread that
 * changes {@link ITerminalTextData} is blocked while the potentially slow
 * drawing is done.
 * <p>
 * <b>Solution:</b> Take a snapshot of the terminal and use the snapshot to draw
 * the content. There is no danger that the data structure get changed while you
 * draw. There are also methods to find out what has changed to minimize the
 * number of lines that get redrawn.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * <b>Drawing optimization</b>: To optimize redrawing of changed lines, this
 * class keeps track of lines that have changed since the previous snapshot.
 * </p>
 *
 * <pre>
 * // iterate over the potentially changed lines
 * for (int line = snap.getFirstChangedLine(); line &lt;= snap.getLastChangedLine(); line++)
 * 	// redraw only if the line has changed
 * 	if (snap.hasLineChanged(line))
 * 		for (int column = 0; column &lt; snap.getWidth(); column++)
 * 			drawCharacter(column, line, snap.getChar(column, line), snap.getStyle(column, line));
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>
 * <b>Scroll optimization:</b> Often new lines are appended at the bottom of the
 * terminal and the rest of the lines are scrolled up. In this case all lines
 * would be marked as changed. To optimize for this case,
 * {@link #updateSnapshot(boolean)} can be called with <code>true</code> for the
 * <code>detectScrolling</code> parameter. The object will keep track of
 * scrolling. The UI must <b>first</b> handle the scrolling and then use the
 * {@link #hasLineChanged(int)} method to determine scrolling:
 *
 * <pre>
 * // scroll the visible region of the UI &lt;b&gt;before&lt;/b&gt; drawing the changed lines.
 * doUIScrolling(snap.getScrollChangeY(), snap.getScrollChangeN(), snap.getScrollChangeShift());
 * // iterate over the potentially changed lines
 * for (int line = snap.getFirstChangedLine(); line &lt;= snap.getFirstChangedLine(); line++)
 * 	// redraw only if the line has changed
 * 	if (snap.hasLineChanged(line))
 * 		for (int column = 0; column &lt; snap.getWidth(); column++)
 * 			drawCharacter(column, line, snap.getChar(column, line), snap.getStyle(column, line));
 * </pre>
 *
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <b>Threading Note</b>: This class is not thread safe! All methods have to be
 * called by the a same thread, that created the instance by calling
 * {@link ITerminalTextDataReadOnly#makeSnapshot()}.
 * </p>
 *
 * @noimplement This interface is not intended to be implemented by clients.
 * @noextend This interface is not intended to be extended by clients.
